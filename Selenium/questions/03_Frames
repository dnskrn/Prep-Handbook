1. What is a frame in Selenium?
Answer: A frame in Selenium is an HTML document embedded inside another HTML document, typically
within an <iframe> (inline frame) or <frame> element. Frames are used to divide a browser window
into multiple sections, each containing a separate HTML document.

2. How do you switch to a frame in Selenium?
Answer: To switch to a frame, you can use the following methods:
driver.switchTo().frame(int index) - Switches to a frame using its index.
driver.switchTo().frame(String nameOrId) - Switches to a frame using its name or ID.
driver.switchTo().frame(WebElement frameElement) - Switches to a frame using a reference
to the frame element.

3. What is the purpose of switching to a frame in Selenium?
Answer: Switching to a frame is necessary when the HTML content you want to interact with is inside
an embedded frame. Without switching, Selenium won't be able to locate and interact with elements
within the frame.

4. How do you switch back from a frame to the default content?
Answer: To switch back to the default content, you can use driver.switchTo().defaultContent();.

5. What is the difference between frame() and defaultContent() methods in Selenium?
Answer: The frame() method is used to switch to a specific frame, while defaultContent() is used to
switch back to the default content (main document). The former requires a reference to the frame,
its name, or index, while the latter doesn't take any arguments.

6. How can you identify if an element is inside a frame or not?
Answer: You can use the driver.switchTo().frame() method and attempt to switch to the frame containing
the element. If the switch is successful, the element is inside that frame. If it fails, the element
is not inside the current frame.

7. What is the risk of not switching to a frame when working with framed content?
Answer: If you don't switch to the correct frame before interacting with elements inside it, Selenium
won't be able to locate those elements, resulting in NoSuchElementException or other errors.

8. Can you interact with elements across frames without switching?
Answer: No, you must switch to the appropriate frame before interacting with elements inside it.
Selenium operates within the context of the currently selected frame, and attempting to interact
with elements in a different frame without switching will likely fail.

9. How do you handle frames with nested frames in Selenium?
Answer: You can use a sequence of driver.switchTo().frame() commands, switching through each level
of nested frames to reach the desired frame.

10. What challenges might you encounter when working with frames in Selenium?
Answer: Challenges include identifying the correct frame, handling nested frames, and ensuring
synchronization with the page to avoid timing issues. Additionally, some browser-specific behaviors
related to frames may need consideration.

11. What are frames in web pages, and why do we need to handle them in Selenium?
Answer: Frames are independent sections within a web page that can display content from different
sources. They act like separate windows within the same browser window. We need to handle frames
in Selenium because elements within a frame are not accessible by default. We need to switch the
browser's focus to the specific frame before interacting with any elements within it.

12. What happens after switching to a frame?
Answer: After switching to a frame, all subsequent Selenium commands will be executed within that
frame until you switch back to the main content or another frame.

13. What challenges can you face when working with frames in Selenium?
Answer: Challenges include identifying the correct frame to switch to, handling nested frames, and
ensuring synchronization, especially in scenarios where frames load asynchronously.

14. How do you handle situations where a frame takes time to load, and your script tries to switch
to it immediately?
Answer: Use explicit waits to ensure that the frame is present and ready for interaction. You can
use `WebDriverWait` along with the `ExpectedConditions.frameToBeAvailableAndSwitchToIt` condition.

15. How do you handle a scenario where nested frames are present within the web page?
Answer: For nested frames, you need to switch through each frame level sequentially:
Identify the parent frame using any of the methods mentioned previously.
Use driver.switchTo().frame(parentFrameElement) to switch to the parent frame.
Within the parent frame, identify and switch to the child frame using similar methods.
After interacting with elements in the child frame, remember to switch back using
driver.switchTo().parentFrame() to move back to the parent frame.
Continue switching back until you reach the main content.

16. What considerations should be taken when dealing with cross-origin frames?
Answer: Cross-origin frames might be subject to Same-Origin Policy restrictions. You may need to
handle security issues, such as using WebDriverWait for elements to be present or adjusting browser
settings.

17. Explain how you would automate a test case where multiple frames with similar characteristics
(like IDs or names) exist, and you need to perform specific actions based on the content within
each frame?
Answer: This scenario requires combining frame handling with content verification:
Iterate through frames: Loop through all frames using driver.findElements(By.tagName("iframe")).
Switch and verify content: For each frame, switch to it using driver.switchTo().frame(frameElement).
Then, identify a unique element or text specific to the content within that frame.
Perform action based on verification: Depending on the verified content, perform the intended action
within the frame using Selenium methods.
Switch back: After the action, switch back to the main content using driver.switchTo().defaultContent()
before iterating to the next frame.

18. Can you provide an example scenario where using frameToBeAvailableAndSwitchToIt is essential?
Answer: This method is particularly useful when dealing with dynamic web pages where frames may
load or change asynchronously, and you want to interact with elements inside those frames.

19. How is frameToBeAvailableAndSwitchToIt different from frameToBeAvailable?
Answer: frameToBeAvailableAndSwitchToIt is an Expected Condition used with WebDriverWait to wait
until a frame is available and switch the driver's focus to that frame. frameToBeAvailableAndSwitchToIt
combines waiting for a frame to be available and automatically switching to it, making it a convenient
one-liner for synchronizing with frames.

WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10);
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.frameToBeAvailableAndSwitchToIt(By.id("frameId")));

Exceptions
==============================================================================================================

NoSuchFrameException:
=====================
1. What is a NoSuchFrameException in Selenium?
Answer: NoSuchFrameException is an exception thrown when Selenium attempts to switch to a frame
that does not exist. This exception occurs when you try to switch to a frame that doesn't exist
on the web page.
This could happen due to:
Incorrect frame identification (ID, name, or index).
The frame being removed from the DOM after the page loads.
The frame not being loaded yet (relevant for dynamically loaded frames).
