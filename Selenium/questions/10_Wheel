7. What is the difference between ScrollToElement() and moveToElement()?
Answer:
Use scrollToElement() when you specifically want to scroll an element and ensure it's fully visible
within the viewport.
Use moveToElement() when your primary focus is moving the mouse cursor to the element, and implicit
scrolling for visibility might suffice.
