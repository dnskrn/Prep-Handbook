1. How do you take a screenshot in Selenium WebDriver?
A: To capture a screenshot in Selenium WebDriver, you can use the following code in Java:
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
TakesScreenshot ts = (TakesScreenshot) driver;
File source = ts.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
FileUtils.copyFile(source, new File("path/to/destination/screenshot.png"));

2. Explain how you can capture a screenshot in Selenium when using a headless browser.
A: When working with a headless browser (like Chrome or Firefox), you can still capture screenshots.
Just make sure to cast the WebDriver to TakesScreenshot and use the same approach as with a regular browser.
Here's an example using Chrome in headless mode:

ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
options.addArguments("--headless");
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(options);
TakesScreenshot ts = (TakesScreenshot) driver;
File source = ts.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
FileUtils.copyFile(source, new File("path/to/destination/screenshot.png"));

3. Can we take the screenshot of element on a page?
A: Yes, we can take the screenshot of the specific element on the page.
TakesScreenshot ts = (TakesScreenshot) driver;
WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.id("button"));
File source = element.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
Files.copyFile(source, new File("path/to/destination/screenshot.png"));

4. What are the different format we have to take screenshot?

5. Can we print the page using Selenium?
A: Yes, we have PrintOptions, PDF classes and PrintsPage Interface. Using these classes and interface
we can print the page using Selenium.

PrintOptions printOptions = new PrintOptions();
Pdf pdf = ((PrintsPage) driver).print(printOptions);
String content = pdf.getContent();
Files.write(OutputType.BYTES.convertFromBase64Png(content), new File("./Selenium_Print.pdf"));
