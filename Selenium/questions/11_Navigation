General
==============================================================================================================

1. How can you navigate to a URL in Selenium WebDriver?
Answer:
driver.get("https://www.example.com");

2. Explain the difference between get() and navigate().to() methods in Selenium WebDriver.
Answer:
Both get() and navigate().to() methods are used to navigate to a URL.

The primary difference is that get() is a part of the WebDriver interface.
Use get() when you want to ensure the page has fully loaded before proceeding with your script
and don't need browser history or session state preservation.

The navigate().to() is a part of the Navigation interface.
Use navigate().to() when you need to navigate between pages within the same session, maintain
browser history, or preserve session state (cookies, authentication).

5. Explain the purpose of navigate().refresh() in Selenium WebDriver?
Answer: navigate().refresh() is used to reload the current page.

6. What is the purpose of driver.navigate().to("about:blank") in Selenium WebDriver?
Answer: This navigates to a blank (empty) page, useful when you want to start fresh
or reset the current session.

7. Explain the purpose of driver.navigate().to("javascript: void(0);") in Selenium WebDriver?

trigger certain events on the page without navigating away.
