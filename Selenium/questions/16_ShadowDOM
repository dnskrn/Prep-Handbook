1. What is ShadowDOM?
ShadowDOM is a web standard that allows encapsulation of DOM subtrees in custom HTML elements.
It enables creation of isolated DOM subtrees and styles, which can be used to build component-
based web applications with encapsulated styling and behavior.

2. How can you interact with elements within a ShadowDOM using Selenium?
Selenium provides methods to execute JavaScript code within the browser, which can be used to
interact with ShadowDOM elements indirectly. Using JavaScriptExecutor, you can access the shadow
root of an element and then traverse the ShadowDOM tree to find and interact with specific
elements.

3. Can you explain the process of interacting with ShadowDOM elements in Selenium?
To interact with ShadowDOM elements in Selenium:
1. Find the parent element containing the ShadowDOM.
2. Use JavaScriptExecutor to retrieve the shadow root of the parent element.
3. Traverse the ShadowDOM tree using JavaScript to locate the desired elements.
4. Perform actions such as clicking, sending keys, or retrieving text using Selenium's
WebElement methods or JavaScriptExecutor.

4. What are some challenges faced when working with ShadowDOM in Selenium?
One challenge is the inability to directly access ShadowDOM elements using standard Selenium
locators such as ID or XPath. Instead, you must rely on JavaScriptExecutor to navigate the
ShadowDOM tree, which can be less intuitive and more error-prone. Additionally, changes to
the ShadowDOM structure or CSS selectors can break the test scripts.

5. How do you handle dynamic ShadowDOM content in Selenium tests?
When dealing with dynamic ShadowDOM content, it's important to ensure that the necessary
elements are present before interacting with them. You can use explicit waits in Selenium
to wait for specific conditions to be met, such as the presence or visibility of elements
within the ShadowDOM.

6. What are the 2 modes in shadow DOM?
In Shadow DOM, there are two modes:
Open Mode:
In open mode, the shadow DOM can be accessed and manipulated by external scripts outside of
the shadow tree. This means that elements within the shadow DOM can be targeted and styled
using regular CSS selectors and JavaScript methods from outside the shadow boundary.

Closed Mode:
In closed mode, the shadow DOM is isolated from the external document and cannot be accessed
or manipulated directly by external scripts. It acts as a closed-off boundary, encapsulating
the internal structure and styles within the shadow host element. This provides encapsulation
and prevents external styles and scripts from affecting the shadow DOM's contents.
