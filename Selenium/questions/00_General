Do we need Selenium Server to run the Selenium WebDriver Scripts?
No. We don't need it. The reason as below.

In earlier days, the selenium scripts are done using the Selenium RC which is known as Selenium RC
Automation Scripts. They by default don't run on the browsers because the Browsers don't trust the
scripts. To, solve this issue Selenium Team came up with an solution and which is Selenium Server,
which has been worked as Mediator / Proxy server between the scripts and the browsers.

Here, the Selenium Server has to be started first, and this server will inject Selenium Core(Kind of
JS code into the Browser) to make the Browser to trust the Selenium RC automation scripts. By, this
way the Selenium RC automation scripts were executed on the Browsers. Over the period of time, the
Browser vendors has became strict and stopped the access for the Selenium Server.

Then, the Selenium Team and Browser vendors came into an agreement were they have created the new
solution which is WebDriver. Earlier the Selenium Team was responsible for the Driver development
and maintenance. But, at present the Browser vendors is taken it up and they create their own drivers
such as ChromeDriver for Chrome Browser, EdgeDriver for Edge Browser and FirefoxDriver for Firefox
browser. The Webdriver can interact with / or execute the automation scripts directly on the Browser.
