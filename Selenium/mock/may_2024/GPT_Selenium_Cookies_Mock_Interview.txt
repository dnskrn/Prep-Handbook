What are cookies in the context of web applications and Selenium WebDriver?

A cookie is a small piece of information which is stored inside the browser. The cookie is used to 
contain the details of user actions on the site, user preferences, session related details and 
tracking informations for the debuggin purposes.

How do you add a cookie to the browser in Selenium WebDriver? Can you provide an example in Java?

A Cookie can be added to the browser using the addCookie() method.

public class CookieDemo {

public static void main(String[] args) {
	Webdriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
	Cookie cookie = new Cookie("CookieName", "CookieValue");
	driver.manage().addCookie(cookie);
	driver.get("https://www.example.com");
	}
}

How do you delete a specific cookie in Selenium WebDriver? Can you provide an example in Java?

Yes. We can delete a specific cookie in Selenium using the deleteCookieNamed() method.
public class CookieDemo {

public static void main(String[] args) {
	Webdriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
	driver.manage().deleteCookieNamed(cookie);
	}
}

How do you delete all cookies in Selenium WebDriver? Can you provide an example in Java?

All cookies can be deleted in Selenium WebDriver using the deleteAllCookies() method.

public class CookieDemo {

public static void main(String[] args) {
	Webdriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
	driver.manage().deleteAllCookies();
	}
}

How do you retrieve a specific cookie by its name in Selenium WebDriver? Can you provide an example in Java?

Yes, we can retrieve the details of the specific cookie using the getCookieNamed() method.

public class CookieDemo {

public static void main(String[] args) {
	Webdriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
	driver.manage().getCookieNamed("cookie");
	}
}

How do you retrieve all cookies in Selenium WebDriver? Can you provide an example in Java?

We can fetch / retrieve the details of all cookies in Selenium using the getCookies() method.

public class CookieDemo {

public static void main(String[] args) {
		Webdriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
		List<Cookie> cookies = driver.manage().getCookies();
		System.out.println(cookies);
	}
}

How can you check if a specific cookie is present in Selenium WebDriver? Can you provide an example in Java?

Not sure. My assumption would be we can use the getCookies() method to retrieve all cookies details and then 
using the if condition we can check the presence of specific cookie using the contains() method.

What is the purpose of using cookies in web applications?

The purpose of using cookies is to store the user preferences, session details, and tracking informations
for debugging uses. Basically a cookie is a small piece information stored on the browser. It contains the 
details of user session and preferences.

How would you handle session cookies in Selenium WebDriver?

A session cookie is nothing but a type of cookie where this cookie will be exists till the session is alive. Once
the session is expired / user logs out. The session cookie will not exists. The session cookies are used to store
user session related details. It can be handled by normal cookie methods.

public class CookieDemo {

public static void main(String[] args) {
		Webdriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
		Cookie cookie = driver.manage().getCookieNamed("SESSION_ID");
		System.out.println(cookie.getName());
		System.out.println(cookie.getValue());
	}
}

Can you explain the importance of the setDomain() and setPath() methods when adding cookies in Selenium WebDriver?

Yes, the setDomain() and setPath() methods are very important when we add any cookie to the browser. The setDomain()
is used to inform that the cookie is valid for which domain. i.e., for the main domain or any other subdomains as well.
Also, the setPath() method is used to inform the path for which the cookie is valid. We can add the cookies in applications
level were the cookie is accessible everywhere. Also, we can add the cookies to specific domain and path too.

public class CookieDemo {

public static void main(String[] args) {
		Webdriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
		Cookie cookie = new Cookie("cName", "cValue", "demo.app", "/resources","25-10-2024", true, true); 
		driver.manage().addCookie(cookie);
	}
}

In the above example, the demo.app and /resources are the subdomain and path.

How would you simulate a user login by setting cookies in Selenium WebDriver?

Yes, we can simulate a user login in Selenium using the addCookie() method. The addCookie() method is used to simulate
the user login method.

public class CookieDemo {

public static void main(String[] args) {
		Webdriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
		Cookie cookie = new Cookie("appLogin", "1wqeoejoiejw_scsajf_sfjefbb", "demo.app", "/","25-10-2024", true, true); 
		driver.manage().addCookie(cookie);
	}
}

What are some common issues you might face when handling cookies in Selenium, and how do you overcome them?

The common issues we face are as below.
1. NoSuchCookieException
2. UnableToSetCookieException
3. InvalidDomaiinCookieException

1. NoSuchCookieException
========================
When we try to interact with some cookie and if that cookie is not available then we will get this exception. To overcome,
Before going to interact with the cookie, first check for presence of the cookie.

2. UnableToSetCookieException
=============================
When we try to add a new cookie and due to some errors / wrong values, the cookie is not able to be added to the browser.
To overcome, please verify the details of the cookie provided before going to add the same.

3. InvalidDomaiinCookieException
================================
When we try to add a new cookie and if suppose the domain we specificed is not the proper domain, the cookie is not able 
to be added to the browser due to issue in domain. To overcome, please verify the domain details of the cookie provided 
before going to add the same.

How do you update the value of an existing cookie in Selenium WebDriver? Can you provide an example in Java?

Well, we don't have any direct method in selenium to update the existing cookie's value. The alternate / workaround is 
we can delete the existing cookie and add the same cookie with updated details and expiry time.

How would you verify the properties of a cookie, such as its expiration date, domain, or path, using Selenium WebDriver?

We can verify the properties of the cookie with the help of the cookie class methods.

public class CookieDemo {

public static void main(String[] args) {
		Webdriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
		Cookie cookie = driver.manage().getCookiedName("cookie1");
		System.out.println(cookie.getName());
		System.out.println(cookie.getValue());
		System.out.println(cookie.getDomain());
		System.out.println(cookie.getPath());
		System.out.println(cookie.getExpiresOn());
		System.out.println(cookie.isSecure());
		System.out.println(cookie.isHttpOnly());
	}
}

Can you explain the difference between persistent cookies and session cookies in the context of Selenium WebDriver?

A session cookie is nothing but a type of cookie where this cookie will be exists till the session is alive. Once
the session is expired / user logs out. The session cookie will not exists. The session cookies are used to store
user session related details.

A persistent cookie is nothing but a type of cookie where this cookie will be exists even after the session is closed, 
which means the cookie will be stored and avaialble even the user logs out from the session. It has its own expiration
time.

================================================
