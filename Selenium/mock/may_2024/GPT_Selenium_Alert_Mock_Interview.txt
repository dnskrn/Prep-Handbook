What is an alert in the context of web applications and Selenium?

An alert is a popup window / modal dialog which is displayed on the webpage when any event occurs
on the webpage. It is used to provide information / warnings in most of the cases. In some cases,
it is used to take authentication values from user and inputs from users.

There are different types of alert as below.
1. Simple Alert - It is a simple JS alert which is used to display information on the webpage
2. Confirm Alert - It is a confirmation JS alert which is used to get the confirmation from user on
the operations to be performed.
3. Prompt Alert - It is a prompt JS alert which is used to take the input value from the user and 
then proceed with operations.

How do you handle a simple alert in Selenium WebDriver? Can you provide an example in Java?

A simple alert in Selenium can be handled with the help of Alert interface. First, we have to 
switch the control to Alert and then we can perform operations on the alert window.
We have a primary method such as accept() which is used to simulate the OK button click on alert
window / popup.

The below code is used to handle the simple alert.

public class AlertDemo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
		driver.get("https://www.example.org");
		Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
		alert.accept();
	}
	
}

How do you handle a confirmation alert in Selenium WebDriver? Can you provide an example in Java?

A confirmation alert in Selenium can be handled with the help of Alert interface. First, we have to 
switch the control to Alert and then we can perform operations on the alert window.
We have 2 primary methods such as accept() and dismiss() which is used to simulate the Ok button click
and Cancel button click on alert window / popup.

The below code is used to handle the confirmation alert.

public class AlertDemo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
		driver.get("https://www.example.org");
		Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
		alert.dismiss();
	}
	
}

How do you handle a prompt alert in Selenium WebDriver? Can you provide an example in Java?

A prompt alert in Selenium can be handled with the help of Alert interface. First, we have to 
switch the control to Alert and then we can perform operations on the alert window.
We have 2 primary methods such as accept() and dismiss() which is used to simulate the Ok button click
and Cancel button click on alert window / popup.
Also, we have getText() and sendKeys() methods to get the content of the prompt alert window and also to
send the input to the prompt alert window.

The below code is used to handle the prompt alert.

public class AlertDemo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
		driver.get("https://www.example.org");
		Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
		String alertContent = alert.getText();
		System.out.println(alertContent);
		alert.sendKeys("Pass");
		driver.accept();
	}
	
}

What methods are available in Selenium WebDriver to interact with alerts?

In selenium, we have below methods to interact with the alerts.
1. switchTo().alert() - It is used to switch to Alert window.
2. accept() - It is used to click Ok button of Alert window.
3. dismiss() - It is used to click Cancel button of Alert window.
4. getText() - It is used to get the content of the Alert window.
5. sendKeys() - It is used to send the input to the Alert window.

How can you retrieve the text of an alert in Selenium WebDriver?

The text of an alert window can be retrieved using the getText() method. The below code can be
used to achieve the same,

public class AlertDemo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
		driver.get("https://www.example.org");
		Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
		String alertContent = alert.getText();
		System.out.println(alertContent);
	}
	
}

How do you dismiss an alert in Selenium WebDriver?

First, we have switch to the alert window and then we can dismiss the alert window by using
the dismiss() method as below.

public class AlertDemo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
		driver.get("https://www.example.org");
		Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
		alert.dismiss();
	}
	
}

How do you accept an alert in Selenium WebDriver?

First, we have switch to the alert window and then we can accept the alert window by using
the accept() method as below.

public class AlertDemo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
		driver.get("https://www.example.org");
		Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
		alert.accept();
	}
	
}

How do you send text to a prompt alert in Selenium WebDriver?

First, we have switch to the alert window and then we can send the text to a prompt alert window by using
the sendKeys() method as below.

public class AlertDemo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
		driver.get("https://www.example.org");
		Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
		alert.sendKeys("Pass");
	}
	
}

What happens if you try to interact with an alert that is not present?

When we try to interact with an alert which is not present on the webpage, then we will get the 
NoAlertPresentException.

try{
	driver.get("https://www.example.org");
	Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
	alert.accept();
} catch(NoAlertPresentException ex) {
	ex.printStackTrace();
}

How can you check if an alert is present in Selenium WebDriver?

We can use the Explicit wait condition to check for the presence of an alert window on the webpage.

The below code can be used to achieve the same.

WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(10));
try{
	wait.until(ExpectedConditions.alertIsPresent());
	Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
	alert.accept();
} catch(NoAlertPresentException ex) {
	ex.printStackTrace();
}

Can you handle alerts using WebDriverWait? If so, how?

Yes. We can handle alerts using WebDriverWait as below. The WebDriverWait can be used to check the
presence of an alert window.

WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(10));
try{
	wait.until(ExpectedConditions.alertIsPresent());
	Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
	alert.accept();
} catch(NoAlertPresentException ex) {
	ex.printStackTrace();
}

What are some common issues you might face when dealing with alerts in Selenium, and how do you overcome them?

We have the below common exceptions which might occurs when dealing with alerts in Selenium.
1. NoAlertPresentException 
Whenever we don't find the alert expected, then we will get the NoAlertPresentException. To overcome this we 
can use the WebDriverWait and ExpectedConditions together with alertIsPresent() to check for the presence of
alert before performing actions with alert.

2. UnexpectedAlertPresentException
UnexpectedAlertPresentException will be thrown when we don't aware of the presence of alert on the webpage.
In this case, to overcome this we can use the WebDriverWait and ExpectedConditions together with alertIsPresent()
to check for the presence of alert before performing actions with alert.
 
3. UnhandledAlertException
Whenever we don't handle the alert present on the webpage, then UnhandledAlertException will be thrown. To overcome
this, we have to carefully check for the alerts present on the page and then handle it properly.

4. NoAlertOpenError
Whenever we don't find the alert expected, then we will get the NoAlertOpenError. To overcome this we 
can use the WebDriverWait and ExpectedConditions together with alertIsPresent() to check for the presence of
alert before performing actions with alert.

5. UnhandledpromptException
Whenever we don't handle the prompt alert present on the webpage, then UnhandledpromptException will be thrown. To 
overcome this, we have to carefully check for the prompt alerts present on the page and then handle it properly.

=================================================
