1. What is file handling in Selenium, and why is it important?

File handling is refers to the concept of uploading the file and also downloading the file. In Banking and 
Ecommerce domain related applications, we have the functionality to uplaod the files and also to download 
the files. In such scenarios, the file handling plays an important role.

2. How can you handle file uploads using Selenium WebDriver?

The file upload cna be handled using the sendKeys() method. To make use of the sendKeys() method for File 
upload, the input tag should be of type file. So, when we have the input tag as file, the sendKeys()
method is used to send the filepath and in the backend the file will be uploaded from the provided path.

3. Provide an example of how to upload a file using Selenium WebDriver.

The file upload example as below.

public class Demo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
		WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
		driver.get("https://www.example.com");
		WebElement fileUpload = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//input[@type='file']"));
		fileUpload.sendKeys("D:\Quality_Metrics\demo.txt");
	}
}

4. How can you handle file downloads using Selenium WebDriver?

The file download can be handled using the ChromeOptions. The ChromeOptions is used to set the default
path for the file download.

public class Demo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
		String fileDownloadPath = "D:\Quality_Metrics\";
		HashMap<String, Object> chromePrefs = new HashMap<String, Object>();
		chromePrefs.put("download.default_directory",fileDownloadPath);
		ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
		options.setExperimentalOption("prefs", chromePrefs);
		WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(options);
		driver.get("https://www.example.com");
		WebElement fileDownload = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//input[@type='file']"));
		fileDownload.click();
	}
}

5. Describe a method to verify if a file has been successfully downloaded using Selenium WebDriver.

Well, we don't have any sepcific or direct method in selenium to validate the download of the file.
But, we can achieve this with the help of Java's file functionality.

String fileDownloadPath = "D:\Quality_Metrics\";
File downloadFile = new File(fileDownloadPath+"sample.txt");
if(downloadFile.isExists()) {
	System.out.println("File downloaded successfully");
}else{
	System.out.println("File download not successfull");
}

Feedback: The provided code has minor syntax issues. Correct isExists() to exists().

6. Explain how to configure the browser settings for file downloads in Selenium WebDriver.

The browser setting can be configured as below for Chrome.

		String fileDownloadPath = "D:\Quality_Metrics\";
		HashMap<String, Object> chromePrefs = new HashMap<String, Object>();
		chromePrefs.put("download.default_directory",fileDownloadPath);
		ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
		options.setExperimentalOption("prefs", chromePrefs);
		WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(options);

For Firefox, we have to configure it using the Firefox profile.

7. How can you handle file uploads on a webpage that does not have a file input element?

When we don't have the file input element on the webpage for file uplaod then the sendKeys()
method can't be used for the same. In this scenario, we have to use the clipboard option, Auto IT
(3rd party) or else Robot framework.

8. Can you provide an example of handling a file upload dialog using AutoIt in Selenium?

I couldn't recollect the code now. But we need to write the VB script to upload file and then it has
to be embedded in our selenium script using the Runtime.exec() fucntionality.

ControlFocus("File Upload", "", "Edit1")
ControlSetText("File Upload", "", "Edit1", "D:\\Quality_Metrics\\demo.txt")
ControlClick("File Upload", "", "Button1")

Runtime.getRuntime().exec("path_to_compiled_script.exe");

9. How do you interact with a file upload dialog using Robot class in Java?

I couldn't recollect the code now. But we need to create the instance of the Robot class and then we
have to perform the sequence of keyboard actions using the KeyDown() and KeyRelease() methods.

public class FileUpload {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws AWTException {
        WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
        driver.get("https://www.example.com");

        WebElement uploadButton = driver.findElement(By.id("upload_button"));
        uploadButton.click();

        Robot robot = new Robot();
        robot.setAutoDelay(2000);

        StringSelection selection = new StringSelection("D:\\Quality_Metrics\\demo.txt");
        Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getSystemClipboard().setContents(selection, null);

        robot.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_CONTROL);
        robot.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_V);
        robot.keyRelease(KeyEvent.VK_V);
        robot.keyRelease(KeyEvent.VK_CONTROL);

        robot.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_ENTER);
        robot.keyRelease(KeyEvent.VK_ENTER);
    }
}

10. Explain how you can handle multiple file uploads in Selenium WebDriver.

Multiple file uploads can be handled with the help of the iteration and loops. We have to add the loop
and each iteration we have to upload the file using the identified fileUpload element. This way we can
handle the multiple file uploads.

11. What are some challenges you might face when handling file uploads and downloads in Selenium?

The challenges
1. Input tag should have type as file otherwise sendKeys() can't be used.
2. File upload element don't have the input tag, then we have to use the 3rd party tools.
3. Use of AutoIt, Robot Class or Clipboard functions are not reliable as it requires the proper
screen focus.

Limited Direct Control: Selenium relies on browser behavior for file uploads and downloads.
Non-Standard File Inputs: Third-party tools might be necessary for non-standard upload methods.
External Dependencies: Tools like AutoIt introduce additional dependencies.

12. How can you read data from a file in Selenium WebDriver?

We can't directly read data from file using Selenium. We have to use the Java file and IO classes to read
data from the file. If suppose the file is hosted on the webpage then the content can be retrieved using
the getText() method.

13. Can you write data to a file using Selenium WebDriver? Provide an example.

No, we can't write the data to a file using Selenium. We have to use the Java's File and IO classes to write
the data into the file.

14. Explain how to handle a CSV file in Selenium WebDriver.

Selenium couldn't handle CSV file. We have the special libraries available on the market which is used to
handle the CSV files.

Improved Answer: CSV files can be handled using libraries like OpenCSV or Apache Commons CSV in Java. Selenium 
itself doesn't have built-in support for file operations.

15. How would you parse an XML file using Selenium WebDriver?

Selenium couln't parse the XML file. We have to use the XMLParser class to parse the XML file.

Improved Answer: XML files can be parsed using libraries like JAXB or DOM/SAX parsers in Java. Selenium itself
doesn't have built-in support for XML operations.

16. Describe how you can handle Excel files (both .xls and .xlsx) in Selenium WebDriver.

Selenium couldn't handle the excel file. We have to use the Apache POI libraries to handle both
.xls and .xlsx type excel files.

17. What libraries would you use for handling Excel files in Selenium WebDriver?

We have many libraries to handle the excel file. The most famous one is Apache POI libraries.

18. Explain how to handle JSON files in Selenium WebDriver.

Selenium couldn't handle the JSON file. The JSON file can be handled using the JSON libraries. We have 
JSON libraries available on the market and using which JSON files can be handled.

19. How can you verify the contents of a downloaded file in Selenium WebDriver?

The contents of the downloaded file can be verified using the Java's File and IO classes. BufferedReader
can be used to read the file contents.

20. What are some best practices for file handling in Selenium WebDriver?

Best Practices
==============
1. Provide the complete file path to upload the file.
2. Make sure the file should be in proper format.
3. Make sure input element has File type attribute.
4. Set the default download directory to download the file.
