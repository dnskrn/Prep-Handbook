What is object casting in Java, and when is it used?

The process of converting the object of one class into the object of another class is called as 
Object Casting. It can also be considered the process of treating the object of one class into 
the object of another class.

ObjectCasting basically works with Inheritance relation. So, if we need to type/object cast
then there should be inheritance relation between the classes.

Downcasting can be used when the child class object needs to access the methods / properties of parent
class.

Upcasting - No Idea. Please provide the answer.

Object casting is commonly used when dealing with inheritance, where you may need to treat a subclass 
object as a superclass object or vice versa.

Explain the difference between upcasting and downcasting.

Upcasting is done automatically by JVM.
The process of assigning the super class/parent class reference to sub/child class is object is called as
Upcasting.

Downcasting is done explicitly by Programmer.
The process of assigning the super class reference to the child class reference is called as Downcasting.

How do you perform upcasting in Java? Provide an example.

Upcasting is done by JVM automatically.

public class CastingDemo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Animal animal = new Dog(); // Upcasting
		animal.eat();
	}

}

class Animal{ 

	public void eat(){
		System.out.println("Animal Eats");
	}
}

class Dog extends Animal {
	
	public void makeSound(){
		System.out.println("Dog barks");
	}
}

How do you perform downcasting in Java? Provide an example.

Downcasting is done by Programmer explicitly.

public class CastingDemo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Animal animal = new Dog();
		Dog dog = (Dog)animal; // Downcasting
		dog.makeSound();
		dog.eat();
	}

}

class Animal{ 

	public void eat(){
		System.out.println("Animal Eats");
	}
}

class Dog extends Animal {
	
	public void makeSound(){
		System.out.println("Dog barks");
	}
}

What is the instanceof operator, and how is it used in object casting?

The instanceof is used to check whether the instance / object is belongs to particular class or not.
The instanceof operator is used in Downcasting. Before going to perform the downcasting we can check
whether the object is belongs to the class or not to avoid the classcastexception.

public class CastingDemo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Animal animal = new Dog(); // Upcasting
		
		if(animal instanceof Dog) {
		    Dog dog = (Dog)animal;
    		dog.makeSound();
    		dog.eat();    
		} else {
		    System.out.println("animal is not instance of Dog");
		}
		
	}

}

class Animal{ 

	public void eat(){
		System.out.println("Animal Eats");
	}
}

class Dog extends Animal {
	
	public void makeSound(){
		System.out.println("Dog barks");
	}
}

Explain the concept of polymorphism in relation to object casting.

Object casting refers/ treats the objects of different sub classes to be as a object of single common interface / class.
So, the object casting works based on the specific type of objects and doesn't care about the methods whereas polymorphism
deals with methods and its works based on the methods declared in the classes. Polymorphism doesn't care about the type but
it checks for the methods. So, both object casting and polymorphism works together for better object oriented programming.

However, you could expand a bit more on how polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated uniformly through
inheritance.

What happens if you perform downcasting without proper type checking?

When we do downcasting without type checking then there could be chance of raise of ClassCastException. So, its better to
check the type before performing the downcasting operation.

However, it would be helpful to explain why this exception occurs - downcasting fails if the object being cast is not actually
an instance of the target class.

How can you avoid ClassCastException when performing downcasting?

The ClassCastException can be avoid in the process of downcasting with the help/use of instanceof operator. It is used to
check the type of the object is belong to the class or not. So, if the objectt type belongs to the class then the instanceof
returns True otherwise it will return False. So, with the use of instanceof operator we can perform downcasting and avoid
the ClassCastException.

What are the limitations of object casting in Java?
The below are my wild guess. Please provide the proper answer.
1. Object Casting is limited to Object type only.
2. Downcasting may throw ClassCastException.
3. Inheritance relation should be compulsory.

One significant limitation is that object casting is only possible between classes with an inheritance relationship. 
Additionally, attempting to cast unrelated classes will result in a compile-time error.

Explain the use of interfaces in object casting.

ObjectCasting relies on the concept of inheritance to perform the type casting of one type to other.
Here, we can have parent class and child class concept where the child extends parent. so, we can 
do type casting between parent and child. The sameway, interface also helps us with inheritance 
where the abstract methods of interface is overriden and implemented by implementation class.
The below example demonstrate the scenario clearly.

public class CastingDemo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Animal animal = new Dog(); // Upcasting
		
		if(animal instanceof Dog) {
		    Dog dog = (Dog)animal;
    		dog.makeSound();
    		dog.eat();    
		} else {
		    System.out.println("animal is not instance of Dog");
		}
		
	}

}

interface Animal{ 

	public void eat();

}

class Dog implements Animal {
	
	public void eat() {
	    System.out.println("Dog eats");
	}
	public void makeSound(){
		System.out.println("Dog barks");
	}
}

Can you cast between unrelated classes in Java? Why or why not?

No. We can't perform type casting operation between unrelated classes. Becuase the type casting requires
the inheritance relation between the classes for which type casting is being done. So, if the classes
are not related then it will throw ClassCastException.

Discuss the role of inheritance in object casting.

The inheritance plays a major role in object casting. Becuase the type casting requires
the inheritance relation between the classes for which type casting is being done. So, the 
Parent class should be extended by the Child class inroder to perform the object casting.

What is the difference between implicit casting and explicit casting in Java?

Implicit Casting
================
1. Automatically done by JVM.
2. It is safe and reliable.

Explicit Casting
================
1. Its explicitly done by Programmer.
2. It is not safe and may throw ClassCastException.

When should you use implicit casting, and when should you use explicit casting?

No Idea. Please provide answer.
Implicit casting should be used when there's no risk of data loss, such as assigning an int to a long.
Explicit casting is necessary when narrowing the data type or performing downcasting.

Provide a scenario where object casting is commonly used in Java development.

No Idea. Please provide answer.
One common scenario is in GUI programming, where different UI components may need to be treated uniformly
despite being instances of different classes.
