What is cohesion in software engineering, and why is it important in system design?

Cohesion refers to the level of dependency/relationship between the data and the members of a class / module / component.
When the dependency/relationship is strong then we call it as high cohesion and when the dependency/relationship is week
then we call it as low cohesion.

Describe the different levels of cohesion. Provide an example for each level.

Functional Cohesion - In this Cohesion, we have code only related to the single functionality of the module.
Sequential Cohesion - In this Cohesion, we have code which executes sequencially for the single operation.
Procedural Cohesion - In this Cohesion, we have code which are grouped as it might use same algorithm for performing operations.
Temporal Cohesion - In this Cohesion,we have code which are related as it executes at sametime.
Communicational Cohesion - In this Cohesion, we have code which operates on same input or produce same output.
Coincidental Cohesion - In this Cohesion, we have code which are not relevant to the operations and all performs different operations.

Why is functional cohesion considered the most desirable type of cohesion? Provide reasons and examples.

Functional Cohesion is type of Cohesion where the code only deals with the single functionality. It's indepent of the other modules.
So, its easy to make updates and maintenance.

class AreaCalc {

	private int radius;
	
	AreaCalc(int radius){
		this.radius = radius;
	}
	
	public double getCircleArea(){
		return Math.PI * radius * radius;
	}
}

public class Demo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		AreaCalc area = new AreaCalc(5);
		System.out.println(area.getCircleArea());
	}
}

What are the consequences of having low cohesion in a software system? How can it impact system design and maintenance?

The low cohesion is a type of cohesion where the members/elements in the class / module are irrelevant to each other and they didn't work for single 
functionality. All the members/elements perform different tasks. When we have different functionality code in single module it becomes difficult
to do changes / remove the code it might impact the other areas. So, when it comes to maintenance of the code its really difficult when we have not
relevant code and also having low cohesion is not valid design format and it should be avoided.

Explain the concept of coupling in software engineering. How does it differ from cohesion?

Coupling refers to the concept of having dependency/relationship between the modules / classes. Cohesion deals with the dependency/relationship
with in the class i.e., between the elements available in the class / module whereas coupling deals with the dependency/relationship between the
classes / modules.

List and briefly describe the different types of coupling. Provide an example for each type.

1. No Coupling - There is no dependency between modules and they are indepent. 
2. Data Coupling - The modules are dependent by sharing the data between them.
3. Stamp Coupling - The modules are indepent, but still share complex datastructures like arrays and objects.
4. Control Coupling - The module1 control the flow of execution of module2 by passing the control flag / parameters.
5. External Coupling - The modules shares the common external data sources.
6. Common Coupling - Mutliple modules access same global data.
7. Content Coupling - It is the strongest form of coupling and should be avoided. In this coupling, the internal implementation details between 
modules are shared.

Why is loose coupling desirable in software systems? Discuss the advantages it offers in terms of flexibility, maintainability, and scalability.

No coupling is also known as Loose Coupling where the modules are not dependent on each other, and they work independently. When we have loose
coupling design, then it will be easy for us to make updates to the module i.e., adding / removing elements from the modules.

Advantages
===========
1. When it comes to flexibility, the module is independent so we updates made to the elements of the module is independent of the other modules 
and really don't dependent on any other modules for impact.
2. When it comes to maintainability, the module is independent of other modules, so the module contains elements which performs single tasks. The 
code maintenance becomes easy as it has only single functionality related code.
3. When it comes to scalability, since the module contains the elements related to single functionality, if incase we need to add more elements
related to single functionality, its easy to scale the module.

Describe a scenario where you would prefer to use high cohesion and loose coupling in system design. How would you achieve this?

Generally we should focus for High Cohesion and Loose Coupling design when we develop any application / framework. Becuase having the
High Cohesion and Loose Coupling helps with better maintenance of Code, provides the flexibility and scalability in making the enhancements
with no / minimal impacts.

Lets have Employee Database System application development, here we might have many modules and will consider two modules
Employee and Department as primary.
Here, the Employee module focus on the Employee related tasks and operations whereas Department module focus on the Department
related tasks and operations. So, this way we can achieve high cohesion as Employee and Department focus on its own module specific
operations, and also the there is should be minimal relation between Employee and Department to get the employee department details. This way, 
we achieve low coupling.

How can you improve cohesion and reduce coupling in an existing software system? Discuss some refactoring techniques or design patterns that can help accomplish this.
No Idea. Please provide your thoughts.

In what ways can excessive coupling between modules or components lead to problems during software development and maintenance? Provide examples from your experience 
or industry best practices.

When we have hard dependency/relationship between the modules then changing the element on module1 will impact the module2. So, whenever we have to do any changes
then we should be thinking of the dependent modules impact. This, way when we change the elements of the one module will have impact on another module. This will
lead to the problems in maintainability of the code.

No example comes to me in mind as of now. Please provide the example with code.

Problems of excessive coupling: You've correctly identified the problems that excessive coupling can lead to during software development and maintenance. Examples could include difficulties in unit testing, increased risk of side effects when making changes, and decreased code readability.


Here are some examples illustrating problems caused by excessive coupling:
=========================================================================== 
Difficulties in Unit Testing:
=============================

Certainly! Here are some examples illustrating problems caused by excessive coupling:

Difficulties in Unit Testing:
Excessive coupling between modules can make it challenging to isolate and test individual components. Here's an example where a tightly coupled class makes unit testing difficult:

// Tightly coupled class
public class ShoppingCart {
    private List<Item> items;

    public void addItem(Item item) {
        items.add(item); // Direct dependency on List<Item>
    }

    public void removeItem(Item item) {
        items.remove(item); // Direct dependency on List<Item>
    }

    public double calculateTotalPrice() {
        double total = 0;
        for (Item item : items) { // Dependency on List<Item>
            total += item.getPrice(); // Dependency on Item.getPrice()
        }
        return total;
    }
}

// Item class
public class Item {
    private String name;
    private double price;

    public double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }
}

In this example, the ShoppingCart class is tightly coupled to the List<Item> data structure and the Item class. Unit testing becomes challenging because we cannot easily replace or mock the dependencies (List<Item> and Item) to isolate the ShoppingCart class for testing.

Increased Risk of Side Effects When Making Changes:
===================================================
Excessive coupling increases the risk of unintended side effects when making changes to one module that affects another module unexpectedly. Here's an example:

// Tightly coupled classes
public class EmailService {
    public void sendEmail(String recipient, String message) {
        // Send email implementation
    }
}

public class UserService {
    private EmailService emailService;

    public UserService() {
        this.emailService = new EmailService(); // Direct instantiation of EmailService
    }

    public void registerUser(String username, String email) {
        // User registration logic
        emailService.sendEmail(email, "Welcome to our platform!"); // Direct dependency on EmailService
    }
}

In this example, the UserService class is tightly coupled to the EmailService class. If we need to change the email sending logic or switch to a different email service provider, we must modify the UserService class, leading to potential side effects and breaking changes.

Decreased Code Readability:
===========================
Excessive coupling can result in code that is difficult to understand and maintain due to tangled dependencies. Here's an example:

// Tightly coupled classes
public class DatabaseConnection {
    public Connection getConnection() {
        // Database connection logic
    }
}

public class ReportGenerator {
    private DatabaseConnection dbConnection;

    public ReportGenerator() {
        this.dbConnection = new DatabaseConnection(); // Direct instantiation of DatabaseConnection
    }

    public void generateReport() {
        Connection conn = dbConnection.getConnection(); // Direct dependency on DatabaseConnection
        // Report generation logic
    }
}

In this example, the ReportGenerator class is tightly coupled to the DatabaseConnection class. Anyone reading the ReportGenerator class may struggle to understand its functionality without understanding its dependencies on the database connection.
