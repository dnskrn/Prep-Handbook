Can you explain what polymorphism is in the context of object-oriented programming?
Polymorphism stands for many forms. When it comes to polymorphism in OOP it refers to doing tasks in multiple ways / forms.
In Java, we have 2 types of polymorphism as below
1. Compile time polymorphism
2. Runtime polymorphism
The example for compiletime polymorphism is Method overloading.
The example for runtime polymorphism is Method overriding.

What are the two main types of polymorphism in Java? Can you provide examples of each?
In Java, we have 2 types of polymorphism as below
1. Compile time polymorphism
2. Runtime polymorphism
The example for compiletime polymorphism is Method overloading.
The example for runtime polymorphism is Method overriding.

How does method overloading contribute to polymorphism in Java?
Method overloading is an example for compiletime polymorphism where a method can have same name with different parameters lists or type of parameters.

class MOExample {

public static void main(String[] args) {
	add(10, 20);
	add(10, 20.10);
	add(10, 20, 30);

}

public static void add(int a, int b) {
System.out.println(a+b);
}

public static void add(int a, float b) {
System.out.println(a+b);
}

public static void add(int a, int b, int c) {
System.out.println(a+b+c);
}

Here, the method add() which is going to get called is decided at the compiletime so its an example for compiletime polymorphism.

What is method overriding, and how does it relate to polymorphism?
Method overriding is an example for runtime polymorphism where a method in child class have an exact implementation of parent class method.

class MOExample {

public static void main(String[] args) {
	Derived d = new Derived();
	d.display(); 
}

class static Base {

public static void display() {
	System.out.println("Parent");
	}

}

class static Derived extends Base {

	public static void display() {
	System.out.println("Child");
	}

}

}

Here, the method display() which is going to get called is decided at the runtime so its an example for runtime polymorphism.

Can you explain the concept of dynamic method dispatch in Java?
Dynamic method display is another name for Method overriding.
Method overriding is an example for runtime polymorphism where a method in child class have an exact implementation of parent class method.

class MOExample {

public static void main(String[] args) {
	Derived d = new Derived();
	d.display(); 
}

class static Base {

public static void display() {
	System.out.println("Parent");
	}

}

class static Derived extends Base {

	public static void display() {
	System.out.println("Child");
	}

}

}

Here, the method display() which is going to get called is decided at the runtime so its an example for runtime polymorphism.


What is the difference between static binding and dynamic binding?
Static binding is another name for method overloading. Method overloading is an example for compiletime polymorphism where a method can have
same name with different parameters lists or type of parameters.

Dynamic binding is another name for method overriding. Method overriding is an example for runtime polymorphism where a method in child class
have an exact implementation of parent class method.

How would you use polymorphism to improve code maintainability and extensibility in a Java application?
No idea at the momemnt. Please provide your thought.

Can you discuss the limitations or drawbacks of polymorphism in Java?
No idea at the momemnt. Please provide your thought.

Explain the "IS-A" relationship and how it relates to polymorphism.
IS-A relationship denotes the use of Inheritance. In polymorphism, the inheritance comes into picture when we go for dynamic polymorphism /
dynamic method dispatch / dynamic binding / runtime polymorphism where both the parent and child classes have the same methods. Also, here
Child class extends Parent class.

How would you decide whether to use method overloading or method overriding in a given scenario?
If the requirement is to do the same action with different inputs / type of inputs then we can use method overloading.
If the requirement is to do have the own implementation instead of some generic / standard implementation for tasks then we can use method overriding.

You've provided solid responses to the questions on polymorphism. Let's go through your answers and provide some feedback:

Explanation of Polymorphism: You've defined polymorphism well, highlighting its essence of "many forms" and how it manifests in Java through compile-time and runtime polymorphism.
Types of Polymorphism: Your explanation of compile-time and runtime polymorphism, along with examples of method overloading and method overriding, effectively illustrates the two main types of polymorphism in Java.
Method Overloading: You've correctly explained how method overloading contributes to polymorphism by allowing multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists to exist in the same class.
Method Overriding: Your explanation of method overriding and its relation to polymorphism is accurate, showcasing how subclass methods can provide specific implementations of superclass methods.
Dynamic Method Dispatch: You've described dynamic method dispatch as another term for method overriding, which is correct. It's the mechanism by which the correct version of an overridden method is invoked at runtime.
Static Binding vs. Dynamic Binding: You've correctly differentiated between static binding (method overloading) and dynamic binding (method overriding).
Using Polymorphism for Maintainability and Extensibility: It's a valid point that polymorphism can improve code maintainability and extensibility by allowing for flexible and modular code that can accommodate changes and additions with minimal impact.
Limitations or Drawbacks of Polymorphism: You mentioned that you have no ideas about this. One limitation could be the potential complexity introduced by inheritance hierarchies and overriding methods, which can sometimes make code harder to understand and maintain.
"IS-A" Relationship and Polymorphism: You correctly related the "IS-A" relationship to polymorphism, highlighting how inheritance is a key aspect of polymorphic behavior.
Deciding Between Method Overloading and Method Overriding: Your explanation of when to use method overloading vs. method overriding is on point, emphasizing the scenarios where each approach is appropriate.

=======================================

Can you explain the concept of method hiding in Java, and how does it relate to polymorphism?
Method hiding is a concept where we override the static method in parent class with static method in child class. Its relates to dynamic polymorphism
where we override the non-static method in parent class with child class method.

class MHExample {

public static void main(String[] args) {
	Derived d = new Derived();
	d.display(); 
}

class static Base {

public static void display() {
	System.out.println("Parent");
	}

}

class static Derived extends Base {

	public static void display() {
	System.out.println("Child");
	}

}

}

Here, the method display() is a static method and at runtime the Parent class method is overriden by child class method. But its not actually overriding.It 
is known as Method Hiding.

What is covariant return type in Java, and how does it support polymorphism?
Covariant return types are the child return types of parent return types. It can be used in Dynamic polymorphism. We have an option in dynamic polymorphism
where the child class method can have the same return type as parent class method else it can have the child return type of the Parent class method return type.

class CovariantExample {

public static void main(String[] args) {
	Derived d = new Derived();
	d.display(); 
}

class static Base {

public Object display() {
	System.out.println("Parent");
	return "Parent";
}
}

class static Derived extends Base {

public String display() {
	System.out.println("Child");
	return "Child";
}

}

}

How do you prevent a method from being overridden in Java?
In Java, we can prevent the method from being overridden by declaring the parent class method as final by which 
we can make it being prevented from overridden. Another option is to have the method in parent class as private method.

Can you discuss the use of the super keyword in method overriding and how it helps maintain polymorphism?
Super keyword is used to access the Parent class data, members and constructor from child class. We can make use of the super keyword incase of 
dynamic polymorphism.

class SuperExample {

public static void main(String[] args) {
	Derived d = new Derived();
	d.display(); 
}

class static Base {

public void display() {
	System.out.println("Parent");
}
}

class static Derived extends Base {

public void display() {
	super.display();
	System.out.println("Child");
}

}

Here, we are calling the display() method of Derived class where it internally calls the display() method of parent class using super keyword.

What are abstract classes and interfaces, and how do they relate to polymorphism?
Abstract classes and Interfaces are one of the core components of OOP concepts of Java where it comes into picture when we talk about the 
abstraction.

Abstract Class is one way to achieve the abstraction where it ranges from 0 to 100% abstraction. Becuase, the abstract class has both 
abstract and concrete classes.

Interface is another way to achieve the abstraction where it has 100% abstraction. Becuase, in interface we only have abstract methods.

Since both the Abstract Class and Interface are the features which helps in abstraction the classes which extends / implements should 
override abstract methods which is declared in abstract class / interface. This way, it relates to the concept of dynamic polymorphism where the
abstract methods are overriden in runtime and executes.

How can you achieve runtime polymorphism in Java without using inheritance?
Inheritance is a feature of OOPs. Inheritance is the concept where we inherit the properties of parent to child and all this happens with 
the help of extends keyword. In dynamic polymorphism, we used to inherit the parent class by child class.

Anotherway of achieving runtime polymorphism is with the help of Interface where we implement the Interface by the Implementation class
and the implementation class override the method of the interface at runtime. This way we can achieve dynamic polymorphism.

Can you explain the concept of upcasting and downcasting in the context of polymorphism?

UpCasting is a process of assigning the Child class object to the Parent class reference.
DownCasting is a process of assigning the Parent class object to the Child class reference.

class Animal {
	
	public void eat() {
	System.out.println("Animal Eats");
	}
}

class Dog extends Animal {

	public void sound() {
	System.out.println("Dog barks");
	}
}

// UpCasting
Animla animal = new Dog();

// DownCasting
Animal animal = new Animal();
Dog dog = (animal) Dog;

How does polymorphism contribute to the concept of code reusability in Java?

In dynamic polymorphism, we use the concept of inheritance where  we extends the parent class in child class through
which the methods and variables of the Parent class can be reused in the Child class.

public class PolyReuseDemo {

class Animal {
	
	public void eat() {
	System.out.println("Animal Eats");
	}
}

class Dog extends Animal {

	public void sound() {
	System.out.println("Dog barks");
	}
}

public static void main() {
	
	Dog dog = new Dog();
	dog.sound();
	dog.eat();
}

}

Discuss the concept of polymorphic variables in Java and provide an example.
No Idea.

What are the advantages of using polymorphism in software development, and can you provide examples from real-world scenarios?
1. Code reusability
2. Easy maintainability
3. Custom implementation using the overriding

public class RealWorldExample {

class ClassRoom {
	
	public String grade = "Seventh";
	
	public void getStudentGrade() {
		System.out.println(grade);
	}
}

class Student extends ClassRoom {

	public String name;
	
	public int age;
	
	Student(String name, int age) {
	
		this.name = name;
		this.age = age;
	}
	
	public void getStudentDetails() {
		System.out.println(name);
		System.out.println(age);
	}
}

public static void main(String []args) {

	Student s1 = new Student("John", 12);
	s1.getStudentDetails();
	s1.getStudentGrade();
	Student s2 = new Student("Alex", 12);
	s2.getStudentDetails();
	s2.getStudentGrade();
}

}

Here, the Student Grade details is defined only once in Class class and reused multiple times for the Student Class.
