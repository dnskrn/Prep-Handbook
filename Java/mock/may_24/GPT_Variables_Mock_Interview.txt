What is a variable in Java?

A variable is a named memory location in Java which is used to hold the value of data type.
Syntax - dataType variableName = value;
Example - int a = 10;

What are the different types of variables in Java?

In java, based on the place of declaration we have 3 types of variables as below.
1. Local variable - Declared inside methods/constructor/blocks.
2. Instance Variable - Declared inside class, but not inside methods/constructor/blocks.
3. Static Variable - Declared with static keyword inside class, but not inside methods/constructor/blocks.

How do you declare a variable in Java?

A variable can be declared with the dataType followed by variable name.
Syntax - dataType variableName = value;
Example - int a = 10;

What are instance variables?

When a variable is declared inside a class but not inside the method / constructor / blocks is called as 
Instance variable. Instance variables are associated with the objects and a separate copy of instance
variables will be created for each instance.

What are class variables?

When a variable is declared inside a class  with static keyword but not inside the method / constructor / 
blocks is called as Static variable. Static variables are associated with the class and only one copy of
variables will be created and shared by all objects.

What are local variables?

When a variable is declared inside a method / constructor / block. It is called as local variables. The local
variable can't be used outside the method / constructor / block.

What is the scope of a variable in Java?

The variables in java have different scope based on the place of declaration.

Local variable - The scope of local variable is only the method in which its declared. As long as the method
exists the variables also exists.

Instance variable - The instance variables declared are associated with the objects which is an instance.
The scope of the instance variable is available as long as the object scope exists and when the objects
are destroyed then the instance variables scope also will be destroyed.

Class variable - The class variables declared at the class level are associated with the class. The scope
of the class variable will lasts as long as the class is loaded and available in the memory.

How do you initialize a variable in Java?

The variables can be initialized as below,

dataType variableName = value (To be initialized).
int a = 10;
String s = "java";
boolean flag = true;

All the variables in java must be initialized before using them.

The instance variables are initialized with default values when the instance is created and the actual values will 
be initialized or updated during the program execution.

The static variables are initialized with default values when class loaded into memory and the actual values will be 
initialized or updated during the program execution.

The local variables are not initialized with default values. They will be initialized with actual values before use.

What is the default value of different types of variables in Java?

The primitive data types (int / float / double / long) has 0
The boolean data type has false
The char data type has '\u0000' 
The String data type has null
The object data type has null

Can you use variables without initialization?

No. We can use variables without initialization. Every variables must be declared and initialized before use in the 
program.

What are final variables?

A variable is said to be final variable when its declared using the final keyword. When we declare the variable as
final, then the value of those variables can't be change once assigned. They are used as constants.

final int a = 10;
a = 20; // Throws Exception

How do you declare a constant variable in Java?

A variable can be declared as constant with the help of final keyword.
Example, public static final int CODE = 100;

While you correctly defined final variables, you can also mention that they must be initialized either during declaration or 
within the constructor. Also, the example provided for constant variable declaration is correct, but it's usually recommended 
to name constants with all uppercase letters for clarity.

What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize in Java?

final - It is a keyword used for variable/method/class.
finally - It is a block used with the try-catch for exception handling.
finalize - It is method which is used to cleanup resources before calling GC.

How do you access variables in Java?

A variable can be accessed by using its variable name.

public class VarDemo {

	int a = 10;
	
	public void show() {
		System.out.println(a);
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		VarDemo demo = new VarDemo();
		demo.show();
	}

}

What is variable shadowing?

When a variable is declared at certain scope let say inside method (inner scope) and in this scenario, a variable 
with same name is declared in the outer scope. This condition is called as Variable shadowing.

Example below explain the variable shadowing.

In the below program, the variable a declared in outer scope and assigned with value 10, in this condition the
same variable is again declared inside the method and assigned with value 20. In this scenario, the variable a
declared inside the method acts a variable shadowing for variable declared in outer scope.

public class VarDemo {

	int a = 10;
	
	public void show() {
	    int a = 20; // Variable Shadowing
		System.out.println(a);
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		VarDemo demo = new VarDemo();
		demo.show();
	}

}

Can you explain the concept of variable hoisting in Java?
No Idea. Please provide the answer.

What are static and non-static variables?

Non-Static Variables
====================
1. Variables declared inside class without static keyword but not inside methods are called as Non-Static variables.
2. Non-Static variables are also called as instance variables. They can be accessed using the
objects of the class.

Static Variables
================
1. Variables declared inside class with static keyword but not inside methods are called as Static variables.
2. Static variables are associated with class and they can shared by objects. They can be accessed using the
ClassName.

How do you access static variables in Java?

The static variables are accessed using the Class Name. They can also be accessed using the object instance. 
But, its recommended to access it using the Class Name.

public class VarDemo {

	static int a = 10;
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
        System.out.println(VarDemo.a);
	}

}

What is the significance of the "static" keyword in variable declaration?

When we declared the variable as static it has below significance,
1. It can be accessed using the class name and no need of object creation.
2. Only one copy is created and shared by all objects. Reduction of memory usage.
3. Static variables are initialized when the class is loaded and before any instance of the class is created.

Can you modify the value of a final variable?

No. We can't modify the value of final variable. Once the value is assigned to final variable
it can't be changed.

===============================================

Great job! Overall, your answers provide a solid understanding of variables in Java. Here's some feedback and corrections:

Variable Initialization: While you mentioned that variables must be initialized before use, it's worth noting that instance variables are initialized with default values when the instance is created, and static variables are initialized with default values when the class is loaded into memory.
Default Values: The default value for char type is not "null character" but '\u0000' (the null character). Similarly, the default value for String is not "null" but null.
Final Variables: While you correctly defined final variables, you can also mention that they must be initialized either during declaration or within the constructor. Also, the example provided for constant variable declaration is correct, but it's usually recommended to name constants with all uppercase letters for clarity.
Variable Shadowing: Your explanation is accurate. You could also add that variable shadowing can lead to confusion and bugs in the code, especially when it's not done intentionally.
Static and Non-static Variables: You explained the concept well. It might be helpful to mention that static variables are shared among all instances of a class and can be accessed without creating an instance of the class.
Static Variable Access: You correctly mentioned that static variables can be accessed using the class name or through an object instance. However, it's important to note that accessing them through an object instance is not recommended because it might give the impression that the variable belongs to that instance.
Static Keyword Significance: You covered the significance of the static keyword well. Just a minor clarification: static variables are initialized when the class is loaded and before any instance of the class is created.
Final Variable Modification: You provided the correct answer that final variables cannot be modified after initialization.
Your understanding of variables in Java seems solid, and your explanations are clear.
