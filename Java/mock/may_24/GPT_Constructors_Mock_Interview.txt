What is a constructor in Java, and what is its purpose?

A constructor is a special type of method in Java. Especially it has the same name as class name. 
Also, it doesn't have any return type.
It is used to initialize the variables during the creation of object instance for a class.

Explain the difference between a constructor and a method in Java.

Constructor
===========
1. Constructor should have same name as class name.
2. Constructor don't have any return type.
3. Constructor is used for initializing the variables.
4. Constructor doesn't required to call explicitly. Whenever object is created
for a class, it will automatically invoked.

Method
=======
1. Method should not have same name as class name. It can have any valid name.
2. Method must have return type. Even if it doesn't return anything it should have void.
3. Method is used for performing some tasks / operations.
4. Method should be called / invoked explicitly using object of a class if its non-static
method and by using class name if its static method.

How do you declare a constructor in a Java class?

A constructor can be declared just like normal method but without return type and name should be same
as class name.

public class ConstructorDemo {
	
	public ConstructorDemo() {
		System.out.println("Constructor Demo");
	}
}

Can a constructor have a return type? Why or why not?

No. A constructor can't have return type. Because the primary job of the Constructor is to 
initialize the variables in java whenever the object instance created for the class. Also,
Constructor is not going to return anything. So, it doesn't need return type.

What is the default constructor, and when does Java provide it?

A Constructor is said to be default when it has no arguments in it. So, a Constructor without
arguments is called as No-Arg / Default constructor. 
Whenever user don't create the default constructor in a class, then Java will provide the 
default constructor at runtime.

What is constructor overloading, and how is it achieved?

Constructor overloading is similar to method overloading where the arguments in the constructor
differs. So, we can have any number of constructors with different arguments by this way we can
achieve constructor overloading.

public class ConstructorDemo {
	
	public ConstructorDemo() {
		System.out.println("Constructor Demo");
	}
	
	public ConstructorDemo(int number) {
		System.out.println("Constructor Demo : "+ number);
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ConstructorDemo demo = new ConstructorDemo();
		ConstructorDemo demo1 = new ConstructorDemo(1);
	}
	
}


How can you call one constructor from another constructor in the same class?

We can call one constructor from another constructor within same class using the this keyword.
Here, in the below example, the parameterized constructor calls the default constructor using the
this() method.

public class ConstructorDemo {
	
	public ConstructorDemo() {
		System.out.println("Constructor Demo");
	}
	
	public ConstructorDemo(int number) {
	    this();
		System.out.println("Constructor Demo : "+ number);
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ConstructorDemo demo1 = new ConstructorDemo(1);
	}
	
}

Can a constructor be private? If yes, why would you make it private?

Yes. A constructor can be declared as private. Whenever we don't want to create / to restrict
the creation of object of a class, then we should declare the constructor as private. By doing
this we can't create the object for the class.

In Singleton Class design pattern the constructor are declared as private inorder restrict the
multiple objects creation.

What is the significance of the this keyword in a constructor?

The this keyword is used to call one constructor from another constructor.

public class ConstructorDemo {
	
	public ConstructorDemo() {
		System.out.println("Constructor Demo");
	}
	
	public ConstructorDemo(int number) {
	    this();
		System.out.println("Constructor Demo : "+ number);
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ConstructorDemo demo1 = new ConstructorDemo(1);
	}
	
}

How do constructors relate to inheritance in Java?

Constructors can be realted to Inheritance as the Parent Class constructor can be accessed by the Child Class
constructor. When we have parent and child classes in java and if parent class has constructor then compulsory
child class should have constructor. When we create the object for Child class, then the child class constructor
will be called and which inturn call parent class constructor implicitly. If we super() keyword in child constructor
then parent class constructor is called explicitly from child class constructor.

class Parent {
	
	public Parent() {
		System.out.println("Parent Demo");
	}
}

class Child extends Parent {
	
	public Child() {
		System.out.println("Child Demo");
	}
}

public class ConstructorInheritanceDemo {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Child child = new Child();
	}

}

What is a constructor chaining? Explain with an example.

Constructor chaining is process of calling one constructor from another constructor. It can be achieved using
the this keyword.

public class ConstructorDemo {
	
	public ConstructorDemo() {
		System.out.println("Constructor Demo");
	}
	
	public ConstructorDemo(int number) {
	    this();
		System.out.println("Constructor Demo : "+ number);
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ConstructorDemo demo1 = new ConstructorDemo(1);
	}
	
}

How do constructors contribute to object initialization in Java?

Constructor are used to initialize the variables and objects of instance of a class. Whenever we 
create the object for a class, it indirectly invokes the constructor which initialize the objects
declared in the class with default values.

Explain the role of constructors in creating immutable objects.
Not sure. Explain this concept.

When would you use a constructor versus a static factory method to create objects?

No Idea about Static Factory Method. Wild assumption with my knowledge on Constructor as below.

Constructors are used to create the objects for number of instance of a class. So, using constructor
we can create N number of instance and the objects will have its own life cycle with respect to instances.

When we go for static factory method, it will create the object and which becomes shared as static is always
class level. So, we use constructor mainly for object creation.

If my assumption is wrong, then please provide the proper answer.

Discuss the differences between default and parameterized constructors.

A constructor is said to be default when it has no arguments / parameters in it. It can be either
created / declared by Programmer or by JVM if its missed to add by Programmer.

A constructor is said to be parameterized when it has arguments / parameters in it. It can be only
created / declared by Programmer based on the requirement.

How does the concept of constructors relate to object-oriented programming principles like encapsulation and abstraction?

No Idea. Let me guess my assumption as below.

In scenario of parent and child classes, when we have constructors in both parent and child, then creating object for child
will invoke child class constructor along with that it also invoke parent class constructor by implicit mechanism. Also, we 
can call the parent class constructor from child class using super keyword. Here, whatever implementation is available in
parent class constructor is not known / hided and only the high level detail like calling constructor is shown. This can
be suitable for abstraction.

When it comes to encapsulation, it refers to the binding of data and member into a single unit. So, basically encapsulation
has private members and public setter & getter methods to access the private methods from outside class / world. Here, the
setter method is used to set the values of private members. Now, in place setter, we can replace it with Constructor and using
Constructor as well we can initialize and set the values to the private members and can be accessed using getter methods. This
can be suitable for encapsulation.

If my assumption is wrong, then please provide the proper answer.

Can you provide an example of using constructors in a real-world scenario?

Yes. In real world scenario, lets take the Employee class where it has to maintain employee related 
details. In this scenario, let say we have members like empName, empAge, empSal, empCity, empMobile.
These values can be initialized and set with the help of Constructor.

public class Employee {

	private String empName;
	private int empAge;
	private double empSal;
	private String empCity;
	private int empMobile;
	
	public Employee(String empName, int empAge, double empSal, String empCity, int empMobile) {
	
		this.empName = empName;
		this.empAge = empAge;
		this.empSal = empSal;
		this.empCity = empCity;
		this.empMobile = empMobile;
	}
	
	public void getEmployeeDetails() {
		System.out.println(empName);
		System.out.println(empAge);
		System.out.println(empSal);
		System.out.println(empCity);
		System.out.println(empMobile);
	}


	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Employee emp = new Employee("John", 30, 50000.00, "Chennai", 12345678);
		emp.getEmployeeDetails();
	}
}


Explain the concept of constructor injection in dependency injection frameworks.

No Idea about Dependency Injection and Constructor Injection. Please provide the answer.

What are the best practices for writing constructors in Java?

Best Practices
==============
1. Constructor should have same name as class name.
2. Constructor shouldn't have any return type.
3. Constructor should be used for initializing the variables.
4. Constructor should have access modifier

Buddy, Please add If I miss anything.

How can you ensure proper resource cleanup when using constructors in Java?

Constructor are related with Object creation. So, whenever don't need the object(reference) then we 
should make it null. This way all its references becomes null and it will be eligible for GC. So, GC
will cleanup and make the resouces free. When the object got destroyed, the constructor linked with
the object is also destroyed and resouce cleanup will be done.
