What is an exception in Java?

An exception in java is an event which disrupts the actual flow of normal execution of the program.
Also, it causes the program to terminate abruptly.

You might also mention that exceptions can occur due to various reasons like user input, hardware 
failures, or issues with network connections.

Explain the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions.

Checked Exception
=================
1. The exception which are occur at compile time and checked by the compiler is called as checked exception.
2. Example - SQLException, FileNotFoundException

Unchecked Exception
===================
1. The exception which are occur at runtime and can't checked by compiler is called as unchecked exception.
2. Example - ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException, NullPointerException

However, it's worth mentioning that checked exceptions are enforced by the compiler at compile time, while 
unchecked exceptions are not.

How do you handle exceptions in Java?

An exception in java is handled using the try-catch block. 

The below code is an example for handling exception in Java.

public class ExceptionDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        try{
            System.out.println(10/0);
        }catch(Exception ex){
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

What is the purpose of the try-catch block?

The try-catch block is used to handle the exception.
The try block is used to enclosed the code which may trhow exception and the catch block is used
to catch the exception thrown by the code inside the try block.

The below code is an example for purpose of try-catch in Java.

public class ExceptionDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        try{
            System.out.println(10/0);
        }catch(Exception ex){
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Can you explain the syntax of a try-catch block?

The try-catch block can be defined as below.

1. The try block is used to enclosed the code which may trhow exception
2. The catch block is used to catch the exception thrown by the code inside the try block.

try {
	// Code that might throw exception
} catch(Exception ex){
	// Catch the exception thrown by try block.
}

What happens if an exception occurs inside a try block?

When an exception is occured inside the try block it will be passed to the catch block.
In the below program, if we analyze the code, inside the try block we have the code which
raises exception. Once, the exception line executes and the control moves to the catch block.
And catch block, catches the exception and print the details.

public class ExceptionDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        try{
            System.out.println(10/0);
        }catch(Exception ex){
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Can you have multiple catch blocks for a single try block? If yes, how?

Yes. We can have multiple catch blocks followed by single try block. 
In the below program, we have 2 catch blocks followed by single try block.
When the exception is thrown, it will be passed to first catch block, if it 
handle, then that will be fine. Otherwise the exeption will be passed to the
second catch block.

public class ExceptionDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        try{
            System.out.println(10/0);
        }catch(ArithmeticException ex){
            System.out.println("Caught the ArithmeticException");
        }catch(Exception ex){
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
		
    }
}

Explain the purpose of the finally block in exception handling.

The finally block will execute irrespective of the exception is thrown or not.
The finally block is used to execute the certain code which should be executed irrespective of the
exception is thrown or not. Let say, the code related to the resources close like DB connection
close / File close stuffs should be written / handled in the finally block. 

public class ExceptionDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        try{
            System.out.println(10/0);
        }catch(ArithmeticException ex){
            System.out.println("Caught the ArithmeticException");
        }catch(Exception ex){
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }finally{
			System.out.println("Inside Finally");
		}		
    }
}

Can you have a finally block without a try block?

No. We can't have a finally block without a try block. Its compulsory to have the finally block
with the try block. If we try to have the finally block without try block, then we will get the 
compile time error.

What is the difference between the catch block and the finally block?

Catch Block - It is used to catch the exception which is being thrown by try block. The exception
can also be handled in the catch block.
Finally Block - It is used to close the resources opened as part of the try block and
it will execute irrespective of exception is thrown or not.

Explain the concept of nested try-catch-finally blocks.

The nested try-catch-finally blocks are a concept where we can have the inner try-catch-finally block isnide the
try block or catch block or finally block. The below syntax explains the same.

try{
	try {
		// Code throws exceptions
		}
	catch(Exception ex){
		// Code handles exception
	}finally{
		// Resource cleanup code
	}
}catch(Exception ex) {

}finally{

}

try{
	
}catch(Exception ex) {
	try {
		// Code throws exceptions
		}
	catch(Exception ex){
		// Code handles exception
	}finally{
		// Resource cleanup code
	}
}finally{

}

try{
	
}catch(Exception ex) {

}finally{
	try {
		// Code throws exceptions
		}
	catch(Exception ex){
		// Code handles exception
	}finally{
		// Resource cleanup code
	}
}

How do you throw an exception manually in Java? 

An exception can be manually thrown in Java using the throw keyword. The throw
keyword is used to throw exception, which is followed by some exception type.

The below program will throw the exception manually when the age is not met the condition.

public class ExceptionDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExceptionDemo.ageCheck(10);
    }
    
    public static void ageCheck(int age) {
        
        if(age < 18)
            throw new RuntimeException("Age is not valid");
    }
}

What is the role of the throws keyword in exception handling?

The throws keyword is used to indicate that the method might throw an exception. The 
throws keyword is used in the method signature.

The below program will explain the usecase of throws.

public class ExceptionDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ExceptionDemo.ageCheck(10);
    }
    
    public static void ageCheck(int age) throws Exception {
        
        if(age < 18)
            throw new RuntimeException("Age is not valid");
    }
}

Can you catch multiple exceptions in a single catch block? If yes, how?
 
Yes. We can catch multiple exceptions in a single catch block using the | pipe or symbol.
We can have 2 or more exceptions can be taken inside the catch block by separating with | symbol.

import java.io.*;
import java.sql.*;
public class ExceptionDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        try{
            
        }catch(IOException|SQLException ex){
            
        }finally{
			
		}		
    }
}

What is the purpose of the Exception class in Java?

The Exception class is the parent class for all types of exception and it is used to the inforamtion of
the all child exceptions and exception details.

How do you create custom exceptions in Java?

A custom exception can be created in Java by extending the Exception class for checked exception and by
extending the RuntimeException class for unchecked exception.

A custom exception is always created to throw the application specific exception.

class CustomException extends RuntimeException {
    
    CustomException(String msg){
        super(msg);
    }
    
}

public class AgeValidator {
    
    static int age = 10;
    
    public static void checkAge() {
        
        if(age < 18)
            throw new CustomException("Age is not valid");
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        AgeValidator.checkAge();
    }
}

When we ran the above program, it will throw the custom exception as below.

Exception in thread "main" CustomException: Age is not valid
	at AgeValidator.checkAge(AgeValidator.java:18)
	at AgeValidator.main(AgeValidator.java:22
	
Explain the concept of exception propagation.

Exception propagation refers to the process of going up the call stack when the exception is 
arised in the method. Let say, we have child method which is called by parent method. Now, the
child method throws exception and it doesn't have the feature to handle exception. So, now the
exception will propagate to the caller stack which is parent method in this case, now if parent
method also don't have feature to handle exception then the exception will be propagate to the
main method. And, if main method also don't have the feature to handle exception, then the exception
will be given to the JVM's built in exception handler which will throw the exception and make the 
program to fail.

What are the differences between throw and throws in Java?

Throw
=====
1. The throw keyword is used to explicitly throw the exception inside the method.
2. throw keyword can be followed by specific exception type / class.


Throws
======
1. The throws keyword is used in the method signature to indicate that the method might
throw an exception.
2. throws keyword can be followed by list of exception types / classes.

How do you handle exceptions in Java 8 and later versions using the try-with-resources statement?

Yes. Until java 7, we were using the try-catch-finally blocks to handle the exception. But, from
java 8, we have the option to use try-with-resources approach to handle the exception.

The try-with-resources is an advanced version of handling exception where we don't need to explicitly
have the finally block to close the resources which are opened as part of try block. The try-with-resources
automatically takes care of closing the resources.

import java.io.*;
public class ExceptionDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        String filePath = "C:\\dataset\\abc.txt";
        try(File file = new File(filePath)){
            if(file.exists()){
                System.out.println("File Exists");
            }
        }catch(IOException ex){
            System.out.println("File Not Found");
        }
    }
}

Can you have a try block without any catch or finally block?

No. We can't have the try block only in java. It has to be either followed by
catch block or finally block. If we try to have only try block then we will get
the compile time error.
