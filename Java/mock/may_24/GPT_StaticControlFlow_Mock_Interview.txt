What is static control flow in Java?

A static control flow refers to the process of execution of static blocks, initialization of static variables
and invocation of the static methods at the time of class loading into memory.

Explain the order of execution for static blocks, static variables, and static methods in a Java class.

Static Block - The static blocks will be executed in the order they appear in the code.
Static Variables - The static variables will be executed in the order they declared in the code.
Static Method - The static methods can be invoked in any order based on the need.

public class SCFDemo {

    static int x; 
    
    static {
        x = 20;
        System.out.println(x);
    }    
    
    public static void display(){
        System.out.println("Static");
    }
    
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    SCFDemo.display();
	}

}

How do static blocks differ from instance blocks in Java?

Static block is used to initialize the static objects and variables, which is executed at the time of
class loaded into memory whereas Instance block is used to initialize the instance objects and variables,
which is executed at the time of object creation.

Can you have multiple static blocks in a Java class? If yes, in what order do they execute?

Yes. We can have multiple static blocks in Java. The static blocks are executed in the order they appear
in the code.

What happens if a class contains both static and instance initialization blocks?

A class can both static and instance initialization blocks. Ideally, the static blocks executes first as
it executes at the time of class loading into memory. Followed by static blocks, the instance block will
execute when the instance of the class is created.

How are static blocks useful in Java?

A static block is useful to initialize the static objects and variables. Apart from this, it can be used
for other initialization tasks as well. Suppose our class / program needs the DB connection to be opened/
Excel file to be loaded, then in those cases, static block will be useful as it executes when the class
is loaded into memory and also it doesn't require any instance creation and therefore saves memory.

Can static blocks access non-static (instance) variables and methods directly?

No. Static blocks are meant to be used with static variables and methods. So, therefore we can't access
non-static members from static block and if we try to do so, then we will get the compile time error.

When are static variables initialized in Java?

The static variables are initialized at the time of class is loaded into memory before the execution of 
static blocks.

How are static variables initialized in Java? Are they initialized when the class is loaded or when the object is created?

The static variables can be initialized inside or outside the static block. The static variables are initialized when
the class is loaded into memory before the creation of objects.

What is the purpose of static initialization blocks?

The purpose of the static block is to initialize the static objects and variables. Apart from this, it can be used
for other initialization tasks as well. Suppose our class / program needs the DB connection to be opened/
Excel file to be loaded, then in those cases, static block will be useful as it executes when the class
is loaded into memory and also it doesn't require any instance creation and therefore saves memory.

How can you ensure that certain initialization code runs only once, regardless of the number of objects created?

When we have static variables and blocks in the code, they will be initialized only once and once initialized, the
values will be maintained throughout the program until it exit, eventhough any number of objects are created.

Is it possible to execute a Java class without a main method? If yes, how?

Until Java6, we can execute the Java class without main method using the static block.
But from Java 6 & above version, the main() method is mandatory for the java class and it is the starting point
of execution.

How do static variables and methods affect inheritance in Java?

Basically the static variables and methods are accessed using the class name. In this situation, lets consider
we have super class and sub class, the super class both static variable and method. The sub class has extends
the super class. Eventhough the object of sub class is created, we can't use the inheritance feature here as the 
static variables and methods are recommended to access using class name only. This way, the inheritance can't be 
used for static members.

What happens if you try to access a static member of a class before the class has been loaded?

Not sure, but error will be thrown.

You've left this question unanswered, mentioning uncertainty about the outcome. The correct answer is that accessing 
a static member before class loading would not be possible as the class must be loaded first.

Can static methods be overridden in Java?

Static methods can't be overridden instead they can be method hided.
