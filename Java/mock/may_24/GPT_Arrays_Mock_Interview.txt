What is an array in Java, and why is it used?

An array is a data structure in Java. It is used to store group of elements of same type.
It is fixed in size.

How do you declare an array in Java?

An array can be declared using the below syntax.
dataType[] arrayName;
int[] a;
float[] b;
String[] c;

Can you initialize an array at the time of declaration? If yes, how?

Yes. An array can be initialized at the time of initialization as below.
int[] a = new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
String[] b = new String[]{"A", "B", "C"};

What is the length of an array, and how is it accessed?

The length of the array refers to the number of elements in the array. The length of the 
array can be accessed using the length property.

int[] a = new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
a.length // It returns 5

How do you access elements in an array?

The elements of the array can accessed using the loops with the help of indexes in Java. We 
can use either normal for loop or enhanced for loop to access the elements of the array.

public class ArrayDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        int[] a = new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        for(int i = 0; i < a.length; i++){
            System.out.println(a[i]);
        }
    }
}

Can the size of an array be changed after declaration? Why or why not?

No. The size of array can't be changed once after declaration. The array in java is fixed in
nature.

Explain the concept of a multidimensional array in Java.

Multidimensional array refers array of arrays, i.e., when an array in java contains arrays inside it,
it is called as multidimensional array. It is represented in tabular format.

How do you declare and initialize a multidimensional array?

A multidimensional array can be declared and initialized as below.
int[][] 2dArray = new int{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}};

What are the different ways to iterate over an array?

The arrays can be iterated in forward and backward directions using Loops.

public class ArrayDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        int[] a = new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
		
		// Forward Iteration
        for(int i = 0; i < a.length; i++){
            System.out.println(a[i]);
        }
        
		// Backward Iteration
        for(int i = a.length-1; i >= 0; i--){
            System.out.println(a[i]);
        }
    }
}

How do you find the sum of elements in an array?

The sum of elements of an array can be calculated as below.

public class ArrayDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        int[] a = new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        
        int sum = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < a.length; i++){
            System.out.println(a[i]);
            sum = sum + a[i];
        }
        System.out.println(sum);
        
    }
}

How can you determine the maximum or minimum element in an array?

We can find the maximum or minimum value of an array by iterating over each element.
The another way to find the maximum or minimum element of an array is using the sort()
method of array class.

import java.util.*; 
public class ArraySort {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        int[] arr = new int[]{2, 3, 1, 5, 4};
        
        int arrLen = arr.length;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < arrLen; i++) {
            
            for(int j = i+1; j < arrLen; j++){
                
                if(arr[i] > arr[j]){
                    int temp = arr[i];
                    arr[i] = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = temp;
                }
            }
        }
        
        System.out.println(arr[0]); // return minimum element
		System.out.println(arr[arrLen-1]); // return maximum element
    }
}

Explain the concept of array cloning. How do you clone an array?
No Idea. Please provide your answer.

You mentioned that you have no idea about array cloning. Array cloning involves creating a new array with the same 
contents as an existing array. You can clone an array using the clone() method or by using Arrays.copyOf() method.

What is the difference between an array and an ArrayList?
Array
=====
1. An array is a data structure in Java. 
2. It is used to store group of elements of same type.
3. It is fixed in size.

ArrayList
=========
1. An arraylist is a collection data structure in Java.
2. It is used to store group of elements of single type using generic feature.
3. It is growable in nature.

How do you sort elements in an array?

The elements of an array can be sort using the sort() method available in Array class.

import java.util.*; 
public class ArraySort {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        int[] arr = new int[]{2, 3, 1, 5, 4};
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr)); // Before sort
		Arrays.sort(arr);
	    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr)); // After sort
    }
}

Can you use arrays with other data structures or classes? If yes, how?
No Idea. Please provide your answer.

Your answer says you have no idea. Arrays can be used with other data structures like LinkedList or Queue, or even
with custom classes where arrays can store objects.
