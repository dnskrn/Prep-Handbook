What is a collection in Java?
Collection is a framework which contains set of interfaces which is used to store, retreive and
manipulate the group of objects.

Explain the difference between a Collection and a Collections in Java.
Collection is a framework which contains list of interfaces.
Collections is a class which contains methods to be used by Collection.

What are the main interfaces in the Java Collections Framework?
The Main Interfaces of Java Collection are,
1. List
2. Map
3. Set
4. Queue

How do you declare a list in Java?

A list can be declared as below.
List list = new ArrayList();
List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();

What is the difference between List and Set in Java?
List
====
1. List is used to store elements of same type / different type.
2. List allows duplicates.
3. List maintains insertion order.

Set
===
1. Set is used to store elements of same type / different type.
2. Set doesn't allow duplicates.
3. Set doesn't maintain any order.

How do you declare a map in Java?

A map can be dedclared as follows,
Map map = new HashMap();
Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<String, String>();
HashMap<String, String> map = new HashMap<String, String>();

Explain the difference between HashMap and HashTable.

HashMap
=======
1. HashMap is used to store objects as key-value pairs.
2. HashMap is not synchronized so at a time any number of threads can access HashMap
3. HashMap is performance wise good when compared to Hashtable.
4. HashMap allows one null key and more than one null values.
5. HashMap stores the objects based on the hashcode.
6. HashTable is not thread safe.

HashTable
=========
1. HashTable is used to store objects as key-value pairs.
2. HashTable is synchronized so at a time only one number of thread can access HashTable
3. HashTable is performance wise low when compared to HashMap.
4. HashTable allows one null key and more than one null values.
5. HashTable stores the objects based on the hashcode.
6. HashTable is thread safe.

What is an ArrayList in Java?

An arraylist is a implementation class of List interface in Collection. The arraylist is used to
store the groups of elements of same type / different type. ArrayList uses dynamic array to store
the group of elements. The arraylist is growable in nature. Insertion into arraylist takes time as
it needs shifting of existing elements whereas accessing the elements of the arraylist is very
fast.It can be declared as below.

ArrayList<String> al = new ArrayList<String>();

How do you add elements to an ArrayList?

An element can be added into arraylist with the help of add() method in ArrayList as below.
ArrayList<String> al = new ArrayList<String>();
al.add("Apple");

import java.util.*;
public class ALDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        ArrayList<String> al = new ArrayList<>();
        al.add("Apple");
        System.out.println(al);
    }
}

How do you remove elements from an ArrayList?

An element can be removed from the arraylist with the help of remove() method in ArrayList as below.
ArrayList<String> al = new ArrayList<String>();
al.add("Apple");
al.remove("Apple");

import java.util.*;
public class ALDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        ArrayList<String> al = new ArrayList<>();
        al.add("Apple");
        System.out.println(al);
        al.remove("Apple");
        System.out.println(al);
    }
}

Explain the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList.

ArrayList
=========
1. An ArrayList is a implementation class of List interface in Collection. 
2. The ArrayList is used to store the groups of elements of same type / different type.
3. ArrayList uses dynamic array to store the group of elements. 
4. The Arraylist is growable in nature. 
5. Insertion into ArrayList takes time as it needs shifting of existing elements whereas accessing the 
elements of the ArrayList is very fast.
6. It can be declared as below.
ArrayList<String> al = new ArrayList<>();

LinkedList
==========
1. A LinkedList is a implementation class of List interface in Collection. 
2. The LinkedList is used to store the groups of elements of same type / different type.
3. ArrayList uses doubly linked list to store the group of elements.
4. The LinkedList is also growable in nature.
5. Insertion into LinkedList is fast whereas accessing / searching the elements in a LinkedList
is slow.
6. It can be declared as below.
LinkedList<String> al = new LinkedList<>();

What is a HashSet in Java?

A HashSet is a implementation class of Set interface in Collection. The HashSet is used to
store the groups of elements of same type / different type. HashSet uses hashcode to store
the group of elements. The HashSet doesn't allow duplicates. The HashSet doesn't maintain the 
order.It can be declared as below.
HashSet<String> hashset = new HashSet<>();

How do you add elements to a HashSet?

Elements can be added to the HashSet with the help of add() method as below.

import java.util.*;
public class HSDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        HashSet<String> hs = new HashSet<>();
        hs.add("Apple");
        System.out.println(hs);
    }
}

The main difference between the HashSet and TreeSet is HashSet doesn't maintain the order of
elements whereas TreeSet maintains the sorted order of elements.

import java.util.*;
public class HSDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        HashSet<String> hs = new HashSet<>();
        hs.add("Apple");

        System.out.println(hs);
        
        TreeSet<String> ts = new TreeSet<>();
        ts.add("Apple");
        ts.add("Grapes");
        ts.add("Banana");
        System.out.println(ts);
    }
	
}

Output
======
[Apple, Grapes, Banana]
[Apple, Banana, Grapes]

What is the purpose of the Iterator interface in Java Collections?

The Iterator interface is used to iterate the elements from the given collection.

import java.util.*;
public class HSDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        HashSet<String> hs = new HashSet<>();
        hs.add("Apple");
        hs.add("Grapes");
        hs.add("Banana");
        System.out.println(hs);
        
        Iterator<String> itr = hs.iterator();
        while(itr.hasNext()){
            System.out.println(itr.next());
        }
    }
}

How do you iterate over elements in a Collection using an Iterator?

The Iterator has 2 methods such as hasNext() and next(). The hasNext() method is used
to check whether the collection has elements in it. The next() method is used to print
the elements from the collection.

Explain the difference between Iterator and ListIterator.

I actually forgot the answer. But the wild guess would be the Iterator can be used for 
any type of collection (list, set, queue and Map) whereas ListIterator can be only used
for list collection. Also, the Iterator can iterate in forward direction whereas the 
ListIterator can iterate in both forward and backward direction.

What is the purpose of the Map.Entry interface in Java Collections?

Inside the Map, the objects are internally stored as an entry and also one key-value pair
in Map is called as an Entry. To get the value as key-value from Map, we can use the Map.Entry
interface.

How do you iterate over elements in a Map?

The elements of the Map can be iterated as below.

import java.util.*;
public class Demo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        HashMap<String, String> hm = new HashMap<String, String>();
        hm.put("101", "Raja");
        hm.put("102", "Mani");

        for(Map.Entry<String, String > a : hm.entrySet()){
            System.out.println(a.getKey()+" "+a.getValue());
        }
    }
}

import java.util.*;
public class Demo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        HashMap<String, String> hm = new HashMap<String, String>();
        hm.put("101", "Raja");
        hm.put("102", "Mani");

        Iterator<Map.Entry<String, String>> itr = hm.entrySet().iterator();
        while(itr.hasNext())
        {
            System.out.println(itr.next());
        }
    }
}

What is the purpose of the Collections class in Java?

The Collections class contains the static utility methods to be used by the Collection interfaces and 
its implementation classes.

Explain the difference between synchronized and unsynchronized collections.

Synchronized collections means the collections used are thread safe and at a time only one thread is 
allowed to access the collection.
UnSynchronized collections means the collections used are not thread safe and at a time morethan one thread is 
allowed to access the collection.

How do you synchronize a collection in Java?

A collection can be synchronized using the below method as follows,
Collections.synchronizedList(al);

import java.util.*;
public class Demo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        ArrayList<String> hs = new ArrayList<>();
        hs.add("Apple");
        hs.add("Grapes");
        hs.add("Banana");
        Collections.synchronizedList(hs);
        Iterator<String> itr = hs.iterator();
        while(itr.hasNext()){
            System.out.println(itr.next());
        }
    }
}

What is the purpose of the Comparable interface in Java Collections?

The Comparable interface is used to sort the objects. It is used within the class. It is
used to sort the objects in the natural sorting order.

How do you sort elements in a collection using the Comparable interface?
Honestly, I forgot the method.

Explain the difference between Comparable and Comparator interfaces.

Comparable Interface is used to sort the objects in the natural sorting order whereas Comparator
Interface is used to sort the objects in the custom sorting order.

What is the purpose of the Comparator interface in Java Collections?

The Comparator interface is used to custom sort the objects. It is used outside the class. It is
used to sort the objects in the custom sorting order.

How do you sort elements in a collection using the Comparator interface?

Honestly, I forgot the method.

What is the difference between fail-fast and fail-safe iterators?

Honestly, I forgot the answer.

How do you create an immutable collection in Java?

The immutable collection can be created using the unmodifiableList() method for List Collection.
Similar way we can do it for other collection.

import java.util.*;
public class Demo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        ArrayList<String> hs = new ArrayList<>();
        hs.add("Apple");
        hs.add("Grapes");
        hs.add("Banana");
        Collections.unmodifiableList(hs);
        Iterator<String> itr = hs.iterator();
        while(itr.hasNext()){
            System.out.println(itr.next());
        }
    }
}

Explain the difference between unmodifiable and immutable collections.
