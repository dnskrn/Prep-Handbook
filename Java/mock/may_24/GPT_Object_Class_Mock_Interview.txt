What is a class in Java, and why is it used?

A class is a blueprint in Java which is used to defined the variables(properties) and methods
(behaviours) of the class. It is used to implement the Object Oriented Programming feature in 
Java.
Example - A car class can define the properties like model, type and color. Also, the accelerate and
brake as behaviours.

Explain the concept of an object in Java.

An object is a realworld entity. It is also known as the instance of the class. The Object
has its own set of attributes i.e., variables(properties) and methods(behaviours).

Example - An object of Car class can have the actual data for the properties like model, type and color. 
Also, the accelerate and brake as behaviours.
Here, the object can be BMW, which is an instance of car,and realworld entity which has its model, type
and color. Also, it has functions like accelerate and brake.

What is the difference between a class and an object?

A class is a blueprint whereas an object is an instance of a class which is created from the blueprint.

How do you define a class in Java? Provide an example.

public class Car {

	private String model;
	
	private String type;
	
	private String color;
	
	public Car(String model, String type, String color) {
		this.model = model;
		this.type = type;
		this.color = color;
	}
	
	public void accelerate(){
		System.out.println("Car accelerate");
	}
	
	public void brake(){
		System.out.println("Car brake");
	}
	
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Car bmw = new Car("A600", "SUV", "Blue");
		System.out.println(bmw.model);
		System.out.println(bmw.type);
		System.out.println(bmw.color);
		bmw.accelerate();
		bmw.brake();
	}
	
}

What are the components of a class in Java?

The components of the class are,
1. Variables
2. Methods

Can you have multiple classes in the same Java file? If yes, explain how.

Yes, we can have multiple classes in same Java file. But of those classes we should have
only one class as public class.

public class Car {

	public void accelerate(){
		System.out.println("Car accelerate");
	}
	
	public void brake(){
		System.out.println("Car brake");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		BMW bmw = new BMW();
		bmw.accelerate();
		bmw.brake();
		bmw.speed();
	}
}

class BMW extends Car {
    
    public void speed() {
        System.out.println("Car speed");
    }
}

What is the purpose of constructors in Java classes?

The constructors are used to initialize the objects. It is invoked implicitly during the 
creation of object for the class.

public class Car {

	private String model;
	
	private String type;
	
	private String color;
	
	public Car(String model, String type, String color) {
		this.model = model;
		this.type = type;
		this.color = color;
	}
		
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Car bmw = new Car("A600", "SUV", "Blue");
		System.out.println(bmw.model);
		System.out.println(bmw.type);
		System.out.println(bmw.color);
	}
	
}

Explain the difference between a constructor and a method.
Constructor
===========
1. Constructor should have same name as class name.
2. Constructor don't have any return type.
3. Constructor is used for initializing the objects.
4. Constructor doesn't required to call explicitly. Whenever object is created
for a class, it will automatically invoked.

Method
=======
1. Method should not have same name as class name. It can have any valid name.
2. Method must have return type. Even if it doesn't return anything it should have void.
3. Method is used for performing some tasks / operations.
4. Method should be called / invoked explicitly using object of a class if its non-static
method and by using class name if its static method.

How do you create an object of a class in Java? Provide an example.

The objects of a class can be created using the new keyword.

ClassName objectName = new ClassName();

public class Car {

	public void accelerate(){
		System.out.println("Car accelerate");
	}
	
	public void brake(){
		System.out.println("Car brake");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Car car = new Car();
		car.accelerate();
		car.brake();
	}
}

What is the default constructor? When is it used?

A Constructor is said to be default when it has no arguments in it. So, a Constructor without
arguments is called as No-Arg / Default constructor. 
Whenever user don't create the default constructor in a class, then Java will provide the 
default constructor at runtime.
Constructor can be used to initialize the objects.

Can you have multiple constructors in a class? If yes, explain how.

Yes, we can have multiple constructors in a class such as default and parameterized constructors.

public class ConstructorDemo {
	
	public ConstructorDemo() {
		System.out.println("Constructor Demo");
	}
	
	public ConstructorDemo(int number) {
		System.out.println("Constructor Demo : "+ number);
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ConstructorDemo demo = new ConstructorDemo();
		ConstructorDemo demo1 = new ConstructorDemo(1);
	}
	
}

What is constructor overloading?

When we have more than one constructor in a class and its parameters are different, then it is said 
to be constructor overloading.

public class ConstructorDemo {
	
	public ConstructorDemo() {
		System.out.println("Constructor Demo");
	}
	
	public ConstructorDemo(int number) {
		System.out.println("Constructor Demo : "+ number);
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ConstructorDemo demo = new ConstructorDemo();
		ConstructorDemo demo1 = new ConstructorDemo(1);
	}
	
}

Explain the concept of instance variables and methods in a class.

The instance variables are related to the object which is an instance of a class.
Separate copy of instance variables will be created for each instance of a class.
The methods which are declared without static keyword are called as instance methods.
The instance methods can be invoked by the instance of a class which is an object.

public class Car {

	private String model;
	
	private String type;
	
	private String color;
	
	public void accelerate(){
		System.out.println("Car accelerate");
	}
	
	public void brake(){
		System.out.println("Car brake");
	}

}

How do you access instance variables and methods of a class?

The instance variables and methods can be accessed by the object / instance of a class.

public class Car {

	private String model;
	
	private String type;
	
	private String color;
	
	public Car(String model, String type, String color) {
		this.model = model;
		this.type = type;
		this.color = color;
	}
	
	public void getCarProperties() {
		System.out.println(model);
		System.out.println(type);
		System.out.println(color);
	}
	
	public void accelerate(){
		System.out.println("Car accelerate");
	}
	
	public void brake(){
		System.out.println("Car brake");
	}
	
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Car bmw = new Car("A600", "SUV", "Blue");
		bmw.getCarProperties();
		bmw.accelerate();
		bmw.brake();
	}
	
}

What is the significance of the "this" keyword in Java?

The this keyword has below significance,
1. It is used to refer the current instance of a class.
2. It is used to differentiate the local and instance variables with same name.
3. It can be used to call one constructor from another constructor.

Explain the difference between static variables/methods and instance variables/methods.

static variables/methods
========================
1. Static variable and methods are class level.
2. Static variable and methods can be accessed / invoked using the class name.
3. Static variable can be shared by all the instance of a class.
4. Static blocks can be used to initialize the static variables and objects.

instance variables/methods
==========================
1. Instance variable and methods are specific to objects.
2. Instance variables and methods can be accessed / invoked using the object / instance of a class.
3. Separate copy of instance variables will be created for each instance.
4. Constructors can be used to initialize the instance variables and objects.

What is a static initializer block? How is it different from a constructor?

Static Block
============
1. A static block is used to initialize the static variables and objects.
2. Static block can be invoked automatically when the class is loaded into memory.

Constructor
===========
1. Constructors can be used to initialize the instance variables and objects.
2. Constructor can be invoked automatically when the object of the class is created.

How do you access static variables and methods of a class?

The static variables and methods of a class can be accessed using the class name.

public class Car {

	private static String model;
	
	private static String type;
	
	private static String color;
	
	static {
		model = "A600";
		type = "SUV";
		color = "Blue";
	}
	
	public static void accelerate(){
		System.out.println("Car accelerate");
	}
	
	public static void brake(){
		System.out.println("Car brake");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println(Car.model);
		System.out.println(Car.type);
		System.out.println(Car.color);
		Car.accelerate();
		Car.brake();
	}
	
}

Explain the concept of encapsulation in Java classes.

Encapsulation is the process of binding the data and methods together into single unit.
In Encapsulation, the variables are declared as private and members are declared as 
public to access the variables from outside class.

class AccountBalance {

	private int balance;
	
	public void setBalance(int balance) {
		this.balance = balance;
	}
	
	public int getBalance() {
		return balance;
	}
}

What are access modifiers, and how are they used in classes?

Access Modifiers are used to set the access level of the class. 
When a class is declared as Public, it can be accessed from anywhere.
When a class is declared as private then it can be inherited
When a class is declares as protected then it can be accessed with same package and by subclass
from outside package.

Explain the difference between public, private, protected, and default access modifiers.

public - Can be accessed from anywhere.
private - Can be accessed only by same class.
protected - Can be accessed with same package and by subclass from outside package.
default - Can be accessed within same package.

How do you achieve data hiding in Java classes?

Abstraction is the process to achieve the data hiding in Java. The abstraction refers to shows
only the high level details and hiding the implementation/internal details.
It can be achieved using abstract class and interface.

What is the role of the "final" keyword in Java classes?

When we declare a variable as final, then the value of the variable can't be changed.
When we declare a method as final, then the method can't be overriden.
When we declare a class as final, then the class can't be inherited.

How do you create a Java package? Why are packages used?

Java package can be created using the Package keyword. The package in java is used to contain
the list of classes / files which are related to each other. So, a package is used to contain
list of interrelated classes / files.

Explain the concept of inheritance in Java classes.

Inheritance is the concept where it has two classes. One class is extended by another class.
Inheritance is the process when the properties of a parent /super class is extended / acquired by the
child / sub class.

class Organization {

	public String department = "HR";
	
	public void getDepartment() {
		System.out.println(department);
	}
}

class Employee extends Organization {
	
	public String empName;
	public int empAge;
	
	Employee(String empName, String empAge) {
		this.empName = empName;
		this.empAge = empAge;
	}
	
	public void getEmployeeDetails() {
		System.out.println(empName);
		System.out.println(empAge);
	}
	
}

What is a superclass and a subclass? How are they related?

Super class and Sub Class concept comes under the Inheritance feature. The class which is extending
the properties of the other class is called as sub class. The properties of the class which is 
being extended by the other class is called as Super class.

How do you achieve inheritance in Java? Provide an example.

Inheritance is achieved using the extends keyword.

class Organization {

	public String department = "HR";
	
	public void getDepartment() {
		System.out.println(department);
	}
}

class Employee extends Organization {
	
	public String empName;
	public int empAge;
	
	Employee(String empName, String empAge) {
		this.empName = empName;
		this.empAge = empAge;
	}
	
	public void getEmployeeDetails() {
		System.out.println(empName);
		System.out.println(empAge);
	}
	
}

What is method overriding? How does it relate to inheritance?

Method overriding is an example for runtime polymorphism where a method in child class have an exact implementation of parent class method.
Method Overriding can be achieved with the help of inheritance through the use of extends keyword.

class MOExample {

public static void main(String[] args) {
	Derived d = new Derived();
	d.display(); 
}

class static Base {

public static void display() {
	System.out.println("Parent");
	}

}

class static Derived extends Base {

	public static void display() {
	System.out.println("Child");
	}

}

}

Here, the method display() which is going to get called is decided at the runtime so its an example for runtime polymorphism.

Explain the difference between method overloading and method overriding.

Method overloading is an example for compiletime polymorphism where a method can have same name with different parameters lists
or type of parameters.

Method overriding is an example for runtime polymorphism where a method in child class have an exact implementation of parent 
class method.

What is the "super" keyword used for in Java classes?

Super keyword is used to access the Parent class data, members and constructor from child class. We can make use of the super keyword incase of 
dynamic polymorphism. Inorder to use the super keyword between child and parent we must extend the parent class in child class with the 
help of inheritance.

public class SuperExample {

public static void main(String[] args) {
	Derived d = new Derived();
	d.display(); 
}

}

class Base {

public void display() {
	System.out.println("Parent");
}
}

class Derived extends Base {

public void display() {
	super.display();
	System.out.println("Child");
}

}
