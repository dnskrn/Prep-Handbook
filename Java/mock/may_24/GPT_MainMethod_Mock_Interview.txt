What is the main method in Java, and why is it important?
main() method in Java is the starting / entry point of any java program execution. Without main()
method no java program will execute. So, ultimately main() method becomes the important feature
for the java prgoram.

Can you explain the signature of the main method in Java?
The main() method has the below signature,

public static void main(String[] args)

public - Access modifier and it should be public as it can be accessed from anywhere from JVM.

static - Since the main() is the starting/entry point of the program. It should be declared as
class level or global level. So, its static. Also, we don't want to create the object for calling
main() which is an overhead.

void - main() method doesn't return any value. so, its return type is void.

main - It is the name of the method.

String[] - It is parameter and its of type string array. It will be useful when we run / execute
program from command line.

What is the purpose of the main method's String array parameter in Java?

The String array parameter is used to pass the command line arguments which is of type string when
we execute the program from command line.

Can a Java program have multiple main methods? Why or why not?

Yes. A java program can have multiple main methods. But, only the main() method with proper signature
would be identified by the JVM.

public class Demo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    System.out.println("Main Method");
	}	
	
	public static void main(int[] args) {
	    System.out.println("Main Method1");
	}	

}

When we have 2 main() methods declared with proper signature then we will get an error saying 
the main() is already defined.

public class Demo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    System.out.println("Main Method");
	}	
	
	public static void main(String[] args) { // Error - method main(String[]) is already defined 
	    System.out.println("Main Method1");
	}	

}

Explain the significance of the public access modifier in the main method.

The main method is declared as public, becuase it has to be accessed from anywhere by the JVM.
If incase, we declare it with private or protected access modifier then main() method can't be
accessed by the JVM.

What happens if the main method is declared as private or protected?

When we declare main() method as private / protected then the JVM couldn't recognize the main()
method and will throw the error. Error: Main method not found in class.

public class Demo {

	private static void main(String[] args) { // Error - Error: Main method not found in class
	    System.out.println("Main Method");
	}	
	
}

Is it possible to run a Java program without a main method? Explain.

We can't run the java program without main() method. Becuase, the main() method is the starting/entry
point of the program.

As per my knowledge, before Java version 6, we can run a java program without main() method. But, from
Java version 6, main() method is compulsory.

What are the valid return types for the main method in Java?

The main() method's valid return type is void. Becuase, the main() method is not going to return any value.

But we can change the return type of main method to int / float / double. But the program can compile
successfully. But will not execute properly and throw error.

public class Demo {

	public static int main(String[] args) { // Error: Main method must return a value of type void in class
	    System.out.println("Main Method");
	    return 0;
	}	
	
}

Can you overload the main method in Java? If yes, how?

Yes, main() method in Java can be overloaded but those overloaded methods will not be recognized by JVM
and they can be invoked like normal method by creating the object for the class. The main() method can
be overloaded by using the difference in parameters.

public class Demo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    System.out.println("Main Method");
	    Demo demo = new Demo();
	    demo.main(1);
	    demo.main("A");
	}
	
	public static void main(int args) {
	    System.out.println("Int Main Method");
	}
	
	public static void main(String args) {
	    System.out.println("String Main Method");
	}
	
}

Explain the difference between the args parameter and the main method's return value.

The args parameter is used to take the String value as array of values. It can be used to pass
the command line arguments to the program when we execute the program from command-line.

The main() method is only used to take input params and process the same. But it will not return
any value. So, the return type of main method is void.

How do you run a Java program from the command line, specifying command-line arguments?

We can run a Java program from command line as below.
1. Navigate to the path where the java file is available.
2. Use the command - javac ClassName.java - To compile and generate the .class file
3. Use the command - java ClassName - To run / execute the program.
4. Use the command - java ClassName arg1 arg2 - To run / execute the program with command-line arguments.

Can you provide an example of how to access command-line arguments inside the main method?

Yes, please find the below example where the command line arguments are used inside the main() method.

Use the command - javac Demo.java - To compile and generate the .class file
Use the command - java Demo "Hello" - To run / execute the program with command-line arguments.

public class Demo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    System.out.println("Main Method");
		System.out.println(args[0]); // Hello
	}
	
}

What is the purpose of the String array parameter in the main method's signature?

The String array parameter in the main() method is used to accept the command-line arguments from the user when 
the program is being executed from the command-line. Since, string is the most widely used data type in java so
we have the args type as String array parameter and also it has the flexibility to convert to any datatype.

Use the command - javac Demo.java - To compile and generate the .class file
Use the command - java Demo "Hello" - To run / execute the program with command-line arguments.

public class Demo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    System.out.println("Main Method");
		System.out.println(args[0]); // Hello
	}
	
}

Explain the order of execution of statements inside the main method.

Inside main() method, the statments are executed in the order they declared / appear in the program.

What happens if the main method throws an exception?

If the main() method throws exception then the program won't run further and stops execution.

In the below example, the second statement inside main is not executed as the main method
throws exception in first statement.

public class Demo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    System.out.println(1/0);
	    System.out.println("Main");
	}
	
}

Can you call the main method explicitly from within another method? Why or why not?

No. We can't call main method explicitly from another method. The main() method is intended to be used/called by
JVM. JVM calls the main() implicitly as its the starting point of the program.

What are some best practices for writing the main method in Java?

Best Practices
==============
1. The main() method should have access modifier should be public otherwise it will not be recognized by JVM.
2. The main() method should be static as its class level and reducing the overhead of object creation / memory usage.
3. The main() method should have void as return type as it doesn't return any value.
4. The main() method should compulsory have name as main otherwise won't recognized by JVM.
5. The main() methos should take String array parameter otherwise won't recognized by the JVM.

How can you handle command-line arguments that are not provided in the expected format or are missing?
Not Sure. Please share your answer.

You mentioned that you weren't sure about this aspect. Handling unexpected or missing command-line arguments usually involves checking
their length or format within the main method and providing appropriate feedback or default behavior.
