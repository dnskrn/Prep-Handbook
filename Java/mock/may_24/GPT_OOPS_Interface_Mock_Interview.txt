What is an interface in Java?

An interface is a blueprint which has only method definitions and the class which is going to implement
the interface is having the implementation details. 
An interface is also called as service contract where it defines the contracts and the class which is 
implementing the interface should adhere to the contract and implement the functionalities.

How do you declare an interface in Java?

An interface can be delcared with the interface keyword as below.

public interface MyInterface {

	void display();
}

The interface don't contain the instance variables and the variables inside interface are by default
public static final and the methods inside the interface are by default public abstract. In addition
to abstract methods, an interfac an contain the default method, static method and private methods.

Can an interface contain variables? If yes, what type of variables?

Yes. An interface contain variables. Those variables are constant variables which means they are public
static final by default and an interface doesn't contain instance variables.

How do you implement an interface in a class?

An interface can be implement by a class using the implements keyword as below, 

interface MyInterface {

	void display();
}

public class Sample implements MyInterface {
	
	@Override
	public void display() {
		System.out.println("Sample Display");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Sample s = new Sample();
		s.display();
	}

}

Can a class implement multiple interfaces in Java?

Yes, a class can implement multiple interfaces at a time in Java as below.

interface MyInterface1 {

	void display();
}

interface MyInterface2 {

	void show();
}

public class Sample implements MyInterface1, MyInterface2 {
	
	@Override
	public void display() {
		System.out.println("Sample Display");
	}
	
	@Override
	public void show() {
		System.out.println("Sample Show");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Sample s = new Sample();
		s.display();
		s.show();
	}

}

What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class in Java?

Interface
=========
An interface can contain only abstract methods.
Interface can be used to achieve 100% or full abstraction.
Interface can't be instantiated.
Morethan one interface can be implemented by a class.

Abstract Class
==============
An abstract class can contain both abstract and concrete methods.
Abstract class can be used to achieve partial or full abstraction.
Abstract class can't be instantiated.
Only one abstract class can be extended by a class.

Can an interface have constructors?

No. Interface don't have constructors. Constructors are related to object instance of a class. Also, its used to
initialize the instance objects. But, interface instance objects are not allowed. So, interface don't have 
constructors.

Can an interface have methods with implementation in Java?

Yes. An interface can have default methods with implementations inside the interface. It is introduced as part of Java8
to support the backward compatibility.

interface MyInterface1 {

	void display();
	
	default void show() {
	    System.out.println("Interface Show");
	}
}


public class Sample implements MyInterface1 {
	
	@Override
	public void display() {
		System.out.println("Sample Display");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Sample s = new Sample();
		s.display();
		s.show();
	}

}

What is a marker interface? Can you provide an example?

An interface which don't have any methods in it is called as Marker Interface. It is used to provide
the information about the implementing class. In Java, we have below Marker interfaces,
1. Serializable
2. Cloneable
3. RandomAccess

Can an interface extend another interface? If yes, how?

Yes. An interface can extend another interface to promote the inheritance and code reusability.

interface MyInterface1 {

	void display1();
	
	default void show() {
	    System.out.println("Interface Show");
	}
}

interface MyInterface2 extends MyInterface1 {

	void display2();
}

public class Sample implements MyInterface2 {
	
	@Override
	public void display1() {
		System.out.println("Sample Display1");
	}
	
	@Override
	public void display2() {
		System.out.println("Sample Display2");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Sample s = new Sample();
		s.display1();
		s.display2();
		s.show();
	}

}

What is the purpose of default methods in interfaces?

The default method is added as part of java8. It is added to provide the backward compatibility.
The default methods can have implementation when used inside the interface. When we need to modify
the interface without affecting the implementation class, then we can use the default methods.

Can a default method be overridden by a class implementing the interface?

Yes. A default method of an interface can be overridden in the implementation class. 

interface MyInterface1 {

	void display1();
	
	default void show() {
	    System.out.println("Interface Show");
	}
}

public class Sample implements MyInterface1 {
	
	@Override
	public void display1() {
		System.out.println("Sample Display1");
	}
	
	@Override
	public void show() {
		System.out.println("Sample Show");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Sample s = new Sample();
		s.display1();
		s.show();
	}

}

What is the significance of static methods in interfaces?

The static methods of an interface is used to have the utility functions needed for the interface.
The static methods of an interfce can't be overridden by the implementing class. The static method
is used to provide the utility support to the interfce.

interface MyInterface1 {

	void display1();
	
	default void show() {
	    System.out.println("Interface Show");
	}
	
	static void greet() {
	    System.out.println("Interface Greeting");
	}
}

public class Sample implements MyInterface1 {
	
	@Override
	public void display1() {
		System.out.println("Sample Display1");
	}
	
	@Override
	public void show() {
		System.out.println("Sample Show");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		MyInterface1 s = new Sample();
		s.display1();
		s.show();
		MyInterface1.greet();
	}

}

How are interfaces used in achieving multiple inheritance in Java?

A class can't extend multiple classes at a time whereas a class can implement multiple interfaces at a time,
with the help of this feature, interface is able to achieve the multiple inheritance in Java.

interface MyInterface1 {

	void display();
}

interface MyInterface2 {

	void display();
}

public class Sample implements MyInterface1, MyInterface2 {
	
	@Override
	public void display() {
		System.out.println("Sample Display1");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		MyInterface1 s = new Sample();
		s.display();
	}

}

Can an interface extend multiple interfaces? If yes, how?

Yes. An interface can extend multiple interfaces.

interface MyInterface1 {

	void display1();
}

interface MyInterface2 {

	void display2();
}

interface MyInterface3 extends MyInterface1, MyInterface2 {
    
    void display3();
}
public class Sample implements MyInterface3 {
	
	@Override
	public void display1() {
		System.out.println("Sample Display1");
	}
	
	@Override
	public void display2() {
		System.out.println("Sample Display2");
	}
	
	@Override
	public void display3() {
		System.out.println("Sample Display3");
	}
	
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Sample s = new Sample();
		s.display1();
		s.display2();
		s.display3();
	}
	
}

Can you provide an example of using interfaces for callback mechanisms?

No Idea. Please provide answer with sample code.

How are interfaces used in Java Collections framework?

Yes, In Java Collections framework, we have Set, List and Map are interface and it has the common contract
methods which should be implemented by the implementing classes such as HashSet, ArrayList, LinkedList and HashMap.

What is the purpose of functional interfaces in Java 8?

The functional interface are used to reduce the lines of code. It is used to have concise coding standard. The funtional
interface have only one abstract method. It is used with Lambda expressions and Method references.

@FunctionalInterface
interface MyFuncInterface {

	void greet(String name);
}

public class Sample {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        MyFuncInterface myfunc = name -> System.out.print("Hello, "+name);
        myfunc.greet("John");        
	}
	
}

Can you explain the concept of marker interfaces and their usage?

The Marker interface is nothing but an interface without any members. It is used to convey / represent
the information about the implementation classes. It is used for metadata, configuration details and 
to provide some additional / specific informations about the implementation classes.
An interface which don't have any methods in it is called as Marker Interface. It is used to provide
the information about the implementing class. In Java, we have below Marker interfaces,
1. Serializable
2. Cloneable
3. RandomAccess

How are interfaces used in Java 8 Streams API?
