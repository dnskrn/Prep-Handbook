What is a thread in Java?

A thread is a light weight process, which is a unit of task execution in a program. 
A program can be split and worked by multiple threads.

How do you create a thread in Java?

A thread can be created with the help of Thread class. The class which needs to create
the thread can extend the Thread class. Actually the thread is created using the 
start() method. When start() method is invoked a new thread will be created.

What are the different ways to create a thread in Java?

A thread can be created by following ways.
1. By extending the Thread class
2. By implementing the Runnable Interface.

By using Thread Class
=====================
public class ThreadDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName());
        MyThread mythread = new MyThread();
        mythread.start();
    }        

}


class MyThread extends Thread {
    
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}


By using Runnable Interface
===========================

public class ThreadDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName());
        Runnable runnable = new MyThread();
        Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
        thread.start();
    }        

}


class MyThread implements Runnable {
    
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

Explain the Thread class and Runnable interface.

Thread class is used to create the thread. The class which needs threads can extends the 
Thread class. The Thread class has a single method called run(). It is used to perform the task by 
thread by the class which has created it.

Runnable Interface is used to create the thread. The class which needs threads can implements
Runnable Interface and pass the instance of runnable to Thread constructor to create the threads.
The runnable interface contains a single method called run(). It is used to perform the task by 
thread by the class which has created it.

What is the difference between extending the Thread class and implementing the Runnable interface to create a thread?

When we create thread by extending the thread class, the we can't extend any other class by this way we might miss the
Object oriented feature of java.

When we create thread by implementing the runnable interface, we can extend the class simultaneously by this way we don't
miss the Object oriented feature of java.

Can you explain the life cycle of a thread in Java?

The life cycle thread goes like below. 
First, the thread will be in new life cycle where the thread will be created.
Second, the thread will be moved to runnable life cycle where the thread will
be ready to takeup task for execution.
Third, the thread will be moved to running life cycle where the thread will
executing the task.
Fourth, thread will be moved to dead life cyle where the thread has completed
the task execution and destroyed.

In above life cycle, at third stage in running life cycle state, the thread may
move into waiting life cycle where the thread will wait.

Once, the thread enters into waiting life cycle then it will again move to runnable
life cycle and then rest of the flow goes on.

What are the states of a thread in Java?

The below are the states of the thread as follows.
New
Runnable
Waiting
Timed Waiting
Terminated

How do you start a thread in Java?

The thread can be started by using the start() method of thread class.

What is the purpose of the start() method in Java threads?

The start() method of thread class is used to create and start the thread.
Wihout the invoking of the start() method, we can't create and start the 
thread in a program.

Can you name some methods of the Thread class?

1. Start()
2. run()

Apart from the above two, I don't have anything as of now. Please provide answer.

How do you pause execution of a thread for a specified amount of time?

Thread execution can be stopped for the specified amount of time using the sleep()
method.

The sleep method takes the timeout in milliseconds and which is used to stop the 
thread execution for the specified time.

Thread.sleep(1000); 

Explain the sleep() method in Java threads.

Thread execution can be stopped for the specified amount of time using the sleep()
method.

The sleep method takes the timeout in milliseconds and which is used to stop the 
thread execution for the specified time.

Thread.sleep(1000); 

What is thread synchronization?

When we talk about multiple threads in Java, then there comes accessing the shared 
resources by multiple threads. Let's consider a scenario where we have multiple threads
trying to acessing the same resource simultaneously. This could lead to a problem. To
overcome this, the synchronization concept is came into picture.

The thread synchronization is the process of accessing the shared resources one by one
by multiple threads which can be made possible with the help of synchronize keyword.

So, when we have scenario where the shared resource need to be accessed by multiple threads
then the resource can be made synchronized using synchronized method or block.

Why is thread synchronization important?

When we talk about multiple threads in Java, then there comes accessing the shared 
resources by multiple threads. Let's consider a scenario where we have multiple threads
trying to acessing the same resource simultaneously. This could lead to a data inconsistency
problem or data corruption.

Inorder to avoid the above data inconsistency / data corruption problem we must make the 
shared resources to be synchronized. The synchronization can be made by making the method / block
as synchronized.

How do you achieve synchronization in Java?

The synchronization can be ahieved by using the following ways
1. Use of synchronize keyword for method / blocks
2. Use of reentrant locks

Can you explain the synchronized keyword in Java?

The synchronized keyword is used to make the shared resource as synchronized that way multiple
threads when try to access it will certainly access it one by one. The synchronized keyword
can be used for methods and blocks.

What are the ways to implement synchronization in Java?

1. Using synchronize keyword to methods and blocks
2. Using reentrant locks

What is a deadlock in Java?

A deadlock is a scenario where two threads are waiting for each other to release a resource which should
be needed by the other thread.

Let's say we have 2 threads t1 and t2, where t1 wants Resource r2 which is with t2 and t2 wants Resource r1
which is with t1. Now, both of them keep on waiting wihout releasing the resouces r1 & r2. This situation is
called as Deadlock.

How can you prevent deadlock in Java?

Dead lock can be prevented by following ways.
1. Using synchronized keyword.
2. Using Reentrant locks.
3. Using the proper thread scheduling policy with fairness enabled.
4. Using careful and proper design.

What is a daemon thread?

A thread with low priority which runs in the background is called as daemon thread. The daemon threads
are used to perform operations like resouce cleanup and garbage collection.

How do you create a daemon thread in Java?

We can a thread as daemon thread by using the setDaemon() method.

Can you explain the setDaemon() method in Java threads?

The setDaemon() method is used to set the thread as daemon thread.

What is the purpose of the yield() method in Java threads?

The yield() method is used to make the running thread to wait for sometime for the threads
of same priority to complete its tasks and then the thread can resume its activity.

How do you join threads in Java?

Thread joins are used to make the thread to wait for the other thread to complete its tasks.

Can you explain the join() method in Java threads?

The join() method is used to make the current thread which is calling the join() method to 
wait for the execution of other thread to complete.

Let's say we have 2 threads t1 and t2. If t1 calls join on t2. then the thread t1 will move into
waiting state until the thread t2 will complete its task.

t1.join(t2);

What is thread pooling?

The thread pooling is collection of pre initialized threads, which can be readily available to pickup
and work on tasks. The thread pool contains collection of currently active threads. The thread pool
eliminates the overhead of creation and destruction of threads for each tasks. Instead, the thread poolc
can re-use the existing threads of threadpool to work on tasks and which helps in perform improvement.

How do you create a thread pool in Java?

The thread pool can be created by using the ExecutorService framework.

Explain the Executor framework in Java.

I believe the Executor framework is used to create the customized thread pool.

What are the advantages of using thread pooling?

Advantages
==========
1. Improved performance.
2. Reuse of existing thread. Eliminates creation of excess / new threads.
3. Maintenance of threads easy.

Can you discuss some best practices for working with threads in Java?

Best practices
==============
1. Create and Destroy the threads properly after the completion of tasks.
2. Use synchronization when multiple threads are going to work on same object.
3. Have ThreadPool in place to avoid new / excess threads creation issue.
4. Have reentrant locks in place.
5. Have proper thread scheduling policy with fairness enabled.
6. Design the application with care.

============================================

Overall, your answers provide a good overview of the topic of Threads in Java. Here's some feedback and corrections:

Methods of the Thread class: Apart from start() and run(), the Thread class also includes methods like sleep(), join(), yield(), interrupt(), isAlive(), setName(), getName(), isDaemon(), setDaemon(), setPriority(), getPriority(), and currentThread(). These methods offer various functionalities for managing and controlling threads.
Thread Synchronization: Your explanation is clear and accurate. However, you might want to mention the use of wait() and notify() methods along with the synchronized keyword for more complex synchronization scenarios.
Deadlock: Your explanation is correct. Additionally, it might be helpful to mention that deadlock prevention often involves careful resource ordering and avoiding holding multiple locks simultaneously.
Daemon Thread: Your explanation is accurate. However, you could also mention that daemon threads are automatically terminated when all non-daemon threads have finished executing or when the program exits.
setDaemon() method: It sets a thread's daemon status. However, it's important to note that once a thread has been started, its daemon status cannot be changed. It must be called before starting the thread.
join() method: Your explanation is correct. However, you could also mention that calling join() with a timeout parameter allows the thread to wait for a specified time for another thread to finish.
Thread Pooling and Executor framework: Your explanation is good. However, you could clarify that the Executor framework provides a higher-level abstraction for managing thread execution and can create and manage thread pools efficiently.
Best Practices: Your list covers important best practices. However, you could elaborate on error handling and logging in multi-threaded environments, as well as the use of thread-safe data structures and avoiding excessive synchronization.
Overall, your understanding of thread-related concepts in Java seems solid. Keep practicing and exploring more advanced topics to strengthen your knowledge further!
