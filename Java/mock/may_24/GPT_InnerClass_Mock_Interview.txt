What is an Inner Class in Java, and why would you use one?

When a class is declared inside another class is called as Inner Class. When we have close functionality
which is going to be utilized by the class only once then that functionality can be created as an inner
class inside the outer class and used. Mostly, the inner class is created to be used by the outer class
and not by the outside class.

Can you explain the different types of Inner Classes in Java?

1. Static Nested Inner Class
2. Non-Static Nested Inner Class
3. Anonymous Inner Class
4. Local Inner Class

How do you define an Inner Class within another class?

Inner Class can be defined inside the Outer class using the class keyword.

public class Outer {
	
	private int a = 10;
	
	public int b = 20;
	
	public void show() {
		System.out.println(a);
		System.out.println(b);
	}
	
	class Inner {
	
		private int c = 30;
		
		public void display() {
			System.out.println(a);
			System.out.println(b);
		}
	
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
		Outer outer = new Outer();
		outer.show();
		Inner inner = outer.new Inner();
		inner.display();
	}

}

What are the advantages of using Inner Classes?

My answer is wild guess. Please provide the proper answer.
Advantages
==========
1. Reduce the creation of new class file.
2. Easy to maintain inside the Outer class.
3. Any change made to the class will not affect others as its inside the Outer class.

Advantages of using Inner Classes: Your answer provides some advantages, but let's refine it:
Advantages:
Encapsulation: Inner classes can encapsulate helper functionality that is closely related to the outer class, improving code organization.
Access to outer class members: Inner classes have access to private members of the outer class, allowing for tighter integration.
Readability: Inner classes can make code more readable by logically grouping related functionality.

Can an Inner Class access the members of its outer class? If yes, how?

Yes, an inner class can access the members of the outer class. It can access both the static and 
non-static members. Even it can access the private members of the outer class.

public class Outer {
	
	private int a = 10;
	
	public static int b = 20;
	
	public void show() {
		System.out.println(a);
	}
	
	public static void display() {
	    System.out.println(b);
	}
	
	class Inner {
	
		private int c = 30;

		public void innerShow() {
			System.out.println(a);
			System.out.println(c);
			show();
		}
		
		public void innerDisplay() {
		    Outer.display();
		}
		
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
		Outer outer = new Outer();
		Inner inner = outer.new Inner();
		inner.innerShow();
		inner.innerDisplay();
		
	}

}

How do you instantiate an Inner Class from within its outer class?

The Inner class can be instantiated within the Outer class using below syntax.
Outer outer = new Outer();
Inner inner = outer.new Inner();

Can an Inner Class be static? If yes, explain the implications.

Yes, we can declare the Inner Class as static. 

public class Outer {
	
	private int a = 10;
	
	public static int b = 20;
	
	public void show() {
		System.out.println(a);
	}
	
	public static void display() {
	    System.out.println(b);
	}
	
	static class Inner {
	
		private static int c = 30;

		public static void innerShow() {
			System.out.println(c);
		}
		
		public static void innerDisplay() {
		    Outer outer = new Outer();
		    outer.show();
		    Outer.display();
		}
		
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Outer.Inner.innerShow();
		Outer.Inner.innerDisplay();
	}

}

What is a Nested Interface, and how is it related to Inner Classes?

When an interface is declared inside the class or interface is called as an Nested interface. A nested interface
can be declared inside the inner class.

public class Outer {
	
	private int a = 10;
	
	public static int b = 20;
	
	public void show() {
		System.out.println(a);
	}
	
	public static void display() {
	    System.out.println(b);
	}
	
	static class Inner {
	
		private static int c = 30;

		public static void innerShow() {
			System.out.println(c);
		}
		
		public static void innerDisplay() {
		    Outer outer = new Outer();
		    outer.show();
		    Outer.display();
		}
		
		interface Iface {
		    void welcome();
		}
		
	}
	
	class SubInner implements Inner.Iface {
	    
	    @Override
	    public void welcome() {
	        System.out.println("Welcome");
	    }
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Outer.Inner.innerShow();
		Outer.Inner.innerDisplay();
		Outer outer = new Outer();
		SubInner subInner = outer.new SubInner();
		subInner.welcome();
	}

}

How does access control work for Inner Classes?

When it comes access control. The inner class can have access to both the static and non-static members
of the outer class. Even the private members of the outer class can also be accessed by the Inner class.
To access the inner class members, first the object of the Outer class is created and the Inner class
object is created with reference of Outer class object. Now, the Inner class object can access the members of
the Inner class.

Can an Inner Class access local variables of a method in its outer class? If yes, under what conditions?
No Idea. I couldn't understand the question.

Yes, an inner class can access local variables of its outer class, but only if the local variables are effectively final or are 
declared as final. This means the variables must not be modified after they are initialized within the method.

public class Outer {
    public void outerMethod() {
        final int x = 10;
        class Inner {
            public void innerMethod() {
                System.out.println(x); // Accessing local variable x
            }
        }
        Inner inner = new Inner();
        inner.innerMethod();
    }
}

How do you instantiate a non-static Inner Class from outside its outer class?

We can instantiate a non-static Inner Class from outside its Outer Class using the OuterClassName.InnerClassName.
The below code is an example for the usecase.
class Outer {
	
	private int a = 10;
	
	public static int b = 20;
	
	public void show() {
		System.out.println(a);
	}
	
	public static void display() {
	    System.out.println(b);
	}
	
	class Inner {
	    
	    public void welcome() {
	        System.out.println("Welcome");
	    }
	}

}

public class InnerClassDemo {
 
 public static void main(String[] args) {
		Outer outer = new Outer();
		Outer.Inner inner = outer.new Inner();
		inner.welcome();
	}
 
}

Can an Inner Class have its own Inner Class? If yes, explain how to define it.

Yes, an Inner class has have its own sub Inner class. The sub Inner class can be defined inside the
Inner class. The Sub Inner class can be accessed using the OuterClassName.InnerClassName.SubInnerClassName.
The below code is an example for the usecase.
class Outer {
	
	private int a = 10;
	
	public static int b = 20;
	
	public void show() {
		System.out.println(a);
	}
	
	public static void display() {
	    System.out.println(b);
	}
	
	class Inner {
	    
	    public void welcome() {
	        System.out.println("Welcome");
	    }
	    
	    class SubInner {
	        
	        public void message() {
	        System.out.println("Message");
	    }
	    }
	}

}

public class InnerClassDemo {
 
 public static void main(String[] args) {
		Outer outer = new Outer();
		Outer.Inner inner = outer.new Inner();
		inner.welcome();
		Outer.Inner.SubInner subInner = inner.new SubInner();
		subInner.message();
	}
 
}

What is the difference between a member Inner Class, a static Nested Class, and a local Inner Class?

Static Nested Class - When we define a static inner class inside the Outer class, it is called as Static
Nested Class.

Local Inner Class - When we define a inner class inside the method of a outer class, it is called as 
Local Inner Class.

Member Inner Class - No Idea. Please provide the answer.

Member Inner Class: An inner class declared at the member level of the outer class. It has access to instance variables 
and methods of the outer class.

Static Nested Class: A static nested class is a nested class that is declared static. It doesn't have access to instance
variables and methods of the outer class unless they are also declared static.

Local Inner Class: A class defined within a method or scope block. It has access to local variables and parameters of the
enclosing method, but those variables must be effectively final.

How does serialization work with Inner Classes?

When the Inner class is serialized the by default the Outer class is also serialized.

What are some best practices for using Inner Classes in Java?

No Idea. Please provide the answer.

Use inner classes judiciously: Inner classes can increase complexity, so use them when they improve code readability 
or organization.

Prefer static nested classes when possible: If the inner class doesn't need access to instance members of the outer 
class, consider making it static to reduce coupling.

Follow naming conventions: Name inner classes appropriately to indicate their purpose and relationship to the outer class.

Minimize visibility: Inner classes should have the narrowest visibility possible to fulfill their purpose. Avoid making
inner classes public if they are only used within the outer class.
