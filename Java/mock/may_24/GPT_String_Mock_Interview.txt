What is a String in Java?

A String is a datatype in Java. It is considered as an Object in Java. It is immutable in nature.
It is used to store the values surrounded by double quotes.
 
How do you declare a String variable in Java?

A String in Java can be declared by 2 ways as below.
1. By String Literal
2. BY using new Keyword.

String literal example - String s1 = "hello";
New keyword exampe - String s2 = new String("Hello");

What is the difference between String and StringBuffer/StringBuilder in Java?

String
======
1. A String is a datatype in Java. It is considered as an Object in Java. 
2. It is immutable in nature.
3. Since String immutable in nature its inherently thread safe.

StringBuffer
============
1. A StringBuffer is a class in Java.
2. It is mutable in nature.
3. It is synchronized so its thread safe.
4. Only one thread is allowed to operate on StringBuffer at a time.

StringBuilder
=============
1. A StringBuilder is a class in Java.
2. It is mutable in nature.
3. It is not synchronized so its not thread safe.
4. More than one thread is allowed to operate on StringBuilder at a time.

Can you explain the immutability of Strings in Java?

Yes, the String is immutable in Java, i.e., once a String is declared and initiailized with a 
value, it can't be changed. If we try to modify the value of String then new object will be
created but the existing object can't be modified. This behaviour of String is called as
immutability of Strings in Java.

How do you concatenate Strings in Java?

A String can be concatenated using below 2 ways.
1. Using + operator
2. Using concat() function

class StringDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        String s1 = "hello";
        String s2 = "world";
        System.out.println(s1+" "+s2);
        System.out.println(s1.concat(" ").concat(s2));
        
    }
}

What is the difference between the "+" operator and the concat() method for String concatenation?

No Idea. Please provide answer.

You've mentioned that you're not sure about this one. The main difference is that the concat() method creates
a new String object, while the + operator internally uses StringBuilder or StringBuffer for concatenation.

How do you compare two Strings in Java?

Strings in Java can be compared by followings 2 ways.

1. By using == operator.
2. By using equals() method.

class StringDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        String s1 = "hello";
        String s2 = "hello";
        String s3 = new String("hello");
        System.out.println(s1==s2); // true
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true 
        System.out.println(s1==s3); // false
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s3)); // true
    }
}

What is the purpose of the equals() method in Java Strings?

The equals() method in Java is used to compare the actual contents of the two strings.

class StringDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        String s1 = "hello";
        String s2 = "hello";
        String s3 = new String("hello");
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true 
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s3)); // true
    }
}

Can you explain the difference between == and equals() when comparing Strings?

Strings in Java can be compared by followings 2 ways.

1. By using == operator. It is used to check the references pointing to same object in memory.
2. By using equals() method. It is used to check the actual contents of the strings.

When we compare 2 string using the == operator, then the == operator is used to check the 
references of both the strings are pointed to same object in memory. If yes, it returns true
else it returns false.

In below exmaple, 
s1 == s2 -> Returns True.
s1 == s3 -> Returns False.
The reason is s1 and s3 are not pointing to the same object in memory.

When we compare 2 Strings using the equals() method, then the equals() method is used to check
only the actual contents of both the strings are same or not. If same, it will return true else
it will return false.

In below exmaple, 
s1.equals(s2) -> Returns True.
s1.equals(s3) -> Returns True.
Here, in both statements it will return True as it checks only content and not the object reference.

class StringDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        String s1 = "hello";
        String s2 = "hello";
        String s3 = new String("hello");
        System.out.println(s1==s2); // true
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true 
        System.out.println(s1==s3); // false
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s3)); // true
    }
}

How do you convert a String to uppercase or lowercase in Java?

A String can be converted into Upper / Lower cases by toUpperCase() and toLowerCase() methods.

class StringDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        String s1 = "hello";
        String s2 = "WORLD";
        System.out.println(s1.toUpperCase()); // HELLO
        System.out.println(s2.toLowerCase()); // world
    }
}

What is the purpose of the trim() method in Java Strings?

The trim() method is used to remove the whitespaces present in the beginning and end of the String.
Note: The trim() method is used to remove the whitespaces which are present in before and end of the
String. The whitespaces present in the middle of the String is not removed.

class StringDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        String s1 = " he llo ";
        System.out.println(s1.trim()); // he llo
    }
}

How do you extract substrings from a String in Java?

The SubString of the String can be extracted using the substring() method.

class StringDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        String s1 = "hello world";
        System.out.println(s1.substring(6));
        System.out.println(s1.substring(6, 11));
    }
}

What is the significance of the indexOf() and lastIndexOf() methods in Java Strings?

The indexOf() method is used to find the first index of the given string whereas lastIndexOf()
method is used to find the last index of the given string.

class StringDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        String s1 = "hello world";
        System.out.println(s1.indexOf("o")); // 4
        System.out.println(s1.lastIndexOf("o")); // 7
    }
}

How do you replace characters or substrings within a String in Java?

We can replace the characters or substring within a string using the replace() method.

class StringDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        String s1 = "hello world";
        System.out.println(s1.replace("o", "a")); // hella warld
        System.out.println(s1.replaceAll("o", "a")); // hella warld
    }
}

What is the difference between String and StringBuilder/StringBuffer in terms of performance?

String
======
String is immutable in nature which makes it inherently thread safe. So, when we do concat 
operation on String, it keep on creating new objects after each concat operation, which 
increases the use of memory and ends in decrease in performance.

StringBuffer
============
StringBuffer is mutable in nature so when we concat strings instead of creating new object, it
will reuse the existing object and modify it. But, its synchronized so at a time only one thread 
is allowed perform the operation which increases the waiting and decreases the performance.

StringBuilder
=============
StringBuffer is mutable in nature so when we concat strings instead of creating new object, it
will reuse the existing object and modify it. But, its not synchronized so at a time morethan one 
thread is allowed to access StringBuilder object, so the performance is increased.

How do you convert a String to an array of characters in Java?

A String can be converted into an array of characters using toCharArray() method.

class StringDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        String s1 = "hello";
        char[] s1Arr = s1.toCharArray();
        for(char c : s1Arr){
            System.out.println(c);
        }
        
    }
}

What is the purpose of the split() method in Java Strings?

The split() method is used to split the given string into arrays of strings based on the delimiter.

class StringDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        String s1 = "The Sky is Clear";
        String[] s1Arr = s1.split(" ");
        for(String c : s1Arr){
            System.out.println(c);
        }
        
    }
}

How do you format Strings in Java using the String.format() method?
I forgot. Please provide the answer.

What are escape sequences in Java Strings, and how do you use them?

The '\' is the escape character in Java String.

The escape sequences are as below.
\s
\S
\t
\r
\n

Can you explain the concept of String interning in Java?
The String interning is a concept, where we a string is declared using String literal, first
the JVM checks whether the declared string object is already available in String Constant Pool.
If its available, then the available object is referenced to the String variable and then returned.
If its not available, then the new object is created and return the reference to the String variable.
