Can you explain the concept of inheritance in Java and how it facilitates code reuse?

Inheritance is a feature of OOPs in Java. Inheritance is a process of getting the parent class 
properties in the Child class. It can be done by using the extends keyword.

When we extend the parent class properties in child class, the child class can reuse the properties
of the parent class without creating the new properties in child class.

class Organization {

	public String department = "HR";
	
	public void getDepartment() {
		System.out.println(department);
	}
}

class Employee extends Organization {
	
	public String empName;
	public int empAge;
	
	Employee(String empName, String empAge) {
		this.empName = empName;
		this.empAge = empAge;
	}
	
	public void getEmployeeDetails() {
		System.out.println(empName);
		System.out.println(empAge);
	}
	
}

public Class InheritanceExample {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
	Employee emp1 = new Employee("John", 30);
	emp1.getEmployeeDetails();
	emp1.getDepartment();
	
	Employee emp2 = new Employee("Alex", 27);
	emp2.getEmployeeDetails();
	emp2.getDepartment();
	
	}
	
}

What are the different types of inheritance supported by Java? Can you provide examples of each?

Java Supports below Inheritance types,
1. Simple Inheritance
2. Multilevel Inheritance
3. Hierarchical Inheritance

Multiple Inheritance is not directly supported by Java as it results in ambiguous call. It is 
supported indirectly by Interface.

Simple Inheritance
==================
When a single child class extends the single parent class it is known as Single Inheritance.

class Organization {

	public String department = "HR";
	
	public void getDepartment() {
		System.out.println(department);
	}
}

class Employee extends Organization {
	
	public String empName;
	public int empAge;
	
	Employee(String empName, String empAge) {
		this.empName = empName;
		this.empAge = empAge;
	}
	
	public void getEmployeeDetails() {
		System.out.println(empName);
		System.out.println(empAge);
	}
	
}

public Class InheritanceExample {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
	Employee emp1 = new Employee("John", 30);
	emp1.getEmployeeDetails();
	emp1.getDepartment();
	
	Employee emp2 = new Employee("Alex", 27);
	emp2.getEmployeeDetails();
	emp2.getDepartment();
	
	}
	
}


Multilevel Inheritance
======================
When a class extends another class and the extended class has extends another class is called as Multilevel Inheritance.

class Organization {

	public String type = "IT Services";
	
	public void getOrgType() {
		System.out.println(type);
	}
}

class Department extends Organization {
	
	public void getHRDepartment() {
		System.out.println("HR");
	}
	
	public void getFinanceDepartment() {
		System.out.println("Finance");
	}
}

class Employee extends Department {
	
	public String empName;
	public int empAge;
	
	Employee(String empName, String empAge) {
		this.empName = empName;
		this.empAge = empAge;
	}
	
	public void getEmployeeDetails() {
		System.out.println(empName);
		System.out.println(empAge);
	}
	
}

public Class InheritanceExample {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
	Employee emp1 = new Employee("John", 30);
	emp1.getEmployeeDetails();
	emp1.getDepartment();
	emp1.getOrgType();
	
	Employee emp2 = new Employee("Alex", 27);
	emp2.getEmployeeDetails();
	emp2.getDepartment();
	emp2.getOrgType();
	
	}
	
}

Hierarchical Inheritance
========================
When a single parent class is inherited by more than one child class, then its known as Hierarchical Inheritance.

class Organization {

	public String type1 = "IT Services";
	public String type2 = "Non-IT Services";
	
	public void getOrgType1() {
		System.out.println(type1);
	}
	
	public void getOrgType2() {
		System.out.println(type2);
	}
}

class NonTechEmployee extends Organization {
	
	public String empName;
	public int empAge;
	
	Employee(String empName, String empAge) {
		this.empName = empName;
		this.empAge = empAge;
	}
	
	public void getEmployeeDetails() {
		System.out.println(empName);
		System.out.println(empAge);
	}
	
}


class TechEmployee extends Organization {
	
	public String empName;
	public int empAge;
	
	Employee(String empName, String empAge) {
		this.empName = empName;
		this.empAge = empAge;
	}
	
	public void getEmployeeDetails() {
		System.out.println(empName);
		System.out.println(empAge);
	}
	
}

public Class InheritanceExample {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
	TechEmployee emp1 = new TechEmployee("John", 30);
	emp1.getEmployeeDetails();
	emp1.getDepartment();
	emp1.getOrgType1();
	
	NonTechEmployee emp2 = new NonTechEmployee("Alex", 27);
	emp2.getEmployeeDetails();
	emp2.getDepartment();
	emp2.getOrgType2();
	
	}
	
}

Multiple Inheritance
=====================
When a child class inherits the properties of more than one parent class is known as Multiple inheritance.

interface ITOrganization {
	
	public void getOrgType();
	
}

interface NonITOrganization {
	
	public void getOrgType();

}

class Employee implements ITOrganization, NonITOrganization {

	public void getOrgType() {
		System.out.println("IT Services");
	}
}

public class MultipleExample {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Employee emp1 = new Employee();
		emp1.getOrgType();
	}

}

Explain the difference between single inheritance and multiple inheritance, and discuss why Java supports single inheritance only.

When a single child class extends the single parent class it is known as Single Inheritance.
When a child class inherits the properties of more than one parent class is known as Multiple inheritance.

When we use single inheritance, then there is only one Parent and one Child class used to achieve the inheritance. So, Parent class
properties can be extended by Child class without any issues.

In case of Multiple inheritance, the Child class is inherits the properties of two Parent classes. In this situation, lets consider
the FirstParent and SecondParent classes have same methods on each classes and if child class extends both classes, then there will
be a ambiguous problem of extending which parent class method in Child class. So, to avoid this problem, Java don't support 
multiple inheritance  through Class but indirectly supported by interface. So, Java supports only single inheritance.

How does method overriding relate to inheritance, and why is it important in the context of polymorphism?

In dynamic polymorphism, that is when we use method overriding, it requires the concept of extending the parent class in child class
and there comes the concept of inheritance into picture where we extends the parent class in child class through extends keyword.
This way, the method overriding and inheritance are related to each other and this way inheritance plays important role in polymorphism.

public class PolyReuseDemo {

class Animal {
	
	public void eat() {
	System.out.println("Animal Eats");
	}
}

class Dog extends Animal {

	@Override
	public void eat() {
	System.out.println("Dog Eats");
	}
}

public static void main() {
	
	Dog dog = new Dog();
	dog.eat();
}

}

Discuss the super keyword in Java and how it is used in the context of inheritance.

Super keyword is used to access the Parent class data, members and constructor from child class. We can make use of the super keyword incase of 
dynamic polymorphism. Inorder to use the super keyword between child and parent we must extend the parent class in child class with the 
help of inheritance.

public class SuperExample {

public static void main(String[] args) {
	Derived d = new Derived();
	d.display(); 
}

}

class Base {

public void display() {
	System.out.println("Parent");
}
}

class Derived extends Base {

public void display() {
	super.display();
	System.out.println("Child");
}

}

What are constructors in inheritance, and how are they invoked in subclasses?

Constructors are special methods in Java which is used to initial the variables at the time of Object creation. Constructors 
are by default invoked at the time of object creation of a class. When it comes to inheritance, the sub class constructors
are called when we create the object for the sub class. Parent class constructor can also be invoked by the use of super keyword.

public class SuperExample {

public static void main(String[] args) {
	SubClass d = new SubClass();
}

}

class BaseClass {

public BaseClass() {
	System.out.println("BaseClass Constructors");
}

}

class SubClass extends BaseClass {

public SubClass() {
	super();
	System.out.println("SubClass Constructors");
}

}

Explain the concept of method hiding in inheritance and provide an example.

Method hiding is a concept where we override the static method in parent class with static method in child class. Its relates to dynamic polymorphism
where we override the non-static method in parent class with child class method.

class MHExample {

public static void main(String[] args) {
	Derived d = new Derived();
	d.display(); 
}

class static Base {

public static void display() {
	System.out.println("Parent");
	}

}

class static Derived extends Base {

	public static void display() {
	System.out.println("Child");
	}

}

}

Here, the method display() is a static method and at runtime the Parent class method is overriden by child class method. But its not actually overriding.It 
is known as Method Hiding.

How does access control (e.g., public, private, protected) apply to inherited members in Java?

public members of the parent class can be accessed by child class from any where.
private members of the parent class can not be accessed by the child class.
protected members of the parent class can be accessed by the child class in same package and from other package.

Discuss the concept of the instanceof operator in Java and its role in inheritance.

class Animal {
	
	public void eat() {
	System.out.println("Animal Eats");
	}
}

class Dog extends Animal {

	public void sound() {
	System.out.println("Dog barks");
	}
}


Animla animal = new Dog();

if( animal instanceof Dog) {
		Dog dog = (animal) Dog;
	}
}

What are the advantages and disadvantages of inheritance in Java? Can you provide examples of when inheritance should be used and when it should be avoided?

Advantages
==========
1. Code Reusability
2. Easy maintanence

Disadvantages
=============
1. When we excessively use the inheritance between the class it makes the dependency harder.
