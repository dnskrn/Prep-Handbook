Questions
=========
1. What is an interface in Java?
An interface is a blueprint that defines a set of methods that a class must implement. It
specifies the behavior a class must exhibit but doesn't provide the implementation details.
An interface in Java is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants,
method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types.

2. How is an interface different from a class?
Interfaces cannot have instance fields, constructors, or non-static methods other than abstract
methods. Additionally, a class can implement multiple interfaces but can only extend one class.

3. What are the key features of interfaces?
1. Interfaces support multiple inheritance of type (a class can implement multiple interfaces).
2. Interfaces are used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
3. Interfaces cannot be instantiated; they can only be implemented by classes or extended by
other interfaces.

4. Can an interface have fields?
Yes, but only constants (static final fields). These fields are implicitly public, static,
and final.

5. Can you provide an example of an interface in Java?
interface Animal {
    void makeSound();
}

6. How do you implement an interface in a class?
To implement an interface, you use the implements keyword in the class declaration followed
by the interface name.

7. Can a class implement multiple interfaces?
Yes, a class can implement multiple interfaces separated by commas.

8. What is the difference between implementing an interface and extending a class in Java?
Implementing an interface means the class promises to provide implementations for all the
methods declared in the interface. Extending a class means inheriting properties and methods
from another class.

9. Can interfaces have constructors?
No, interfaces cannot have constructors because they cannot be instantiated.

10. What are default methods in interfaces?
Default methods are methods in interfaces that have a default implementation. They were
introduced in Java 8 to provide backward compatibility for existing interfaces when new
methods are added.

11. Can default methods be overridden?
Yes, default methods can be overridden by implementing classes.

12. What are static methods in interfaces?
Static methods in interfaces are methods that are associated with the interface itself, not
with any instance of a class implementing the interface.

13. Can static methods in interfaces be inherited?
No, static methods in interfaces cannot be inherited or overridden.

14. Can you create an object of an interface?
No, you cannot create an object of an interface directly. Interfaces only define what a class
can do, not how it does it. You can create a reference variable of the interface type and
assign it to an object of a class that implements the interface.

15. What are the benefits of using interfaces?
Achieve abstraction: Separates the "what" from the "how", promoting loose coupling and
code reusability.
Promote polymorphism: Enables different classes to implement the same interface methods
in different ways.
Define contracts: Interface methods act as a contract between a class and the outside world,
ensuring it provides the expected functionality.

16. What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class?
Both interfaces and abstract classes promote abstraction, but with key differences:
Method implementation: Interfaces only declare abstract methods, while abstract classes can
have both abstract and concrete methods.
Inheritance: A class can implement multiple interfaces but can only extend one abstract class
(avoiding the diamond problem).

17. What are marker interfaces?
Marker interfaces are interfaces with no method declarations. They are used to provide additional
information about a class without defining any specific behavior. (e.g., Serializable interface).
A marker interface in Java is an interface with no methods or constants, it acts as a tag to inform
the compiler or runtime environment about some special behavior of the implementing class. The
presence of a marker interface signifies that instances of the implementing class possess certain
capabilities or characteristics.
Examples of marker interfaces in Java include:
==============================================
Serializable: Indicates that objects of the implementing class can be serialized.
Cloneable: Indicates that objects of the implementing class can be cloned.
RandomAccess: Indicates that collections can support fast random access.

18. What are the new features introduced for interfaces in Java 8?
1. Default methods: Allow interfaces to define method implementations with a default behavior.
2. Static methods: Interfaces can now contain static utility methods.
3. Functional interfaces: Interfaces with a single abstract method can be used with lambda
expressions and method references.

19. Explain the difference between interface inheritance and class inheritance. When would you
use each?
Interface inheritance: A class can implement multiple interfaces, inheriting methods from each.
Useful for promoting polymorphism and achieving multiple functionalities.
Class inheritance: A class extends one parent class, inheriting all its methods and fields.
Used for code reusability and creating specialized subclasses.

20. How would you handle situations where multiple interfaces have methods with the same signature?
If the methods have the same functionality, consider using a single interface.
If functionalities differ, ensure clear naming conventions and document the purpose of
each method.
In rare cases, anonymous classes can be used to provide temporary implementations for
resolving conflicts.

21. Explain how interfaces can be used to achieve loose coupling in large-scale Java applications.
Interfaces define contracts, allowing different implementations without modifying
dependent code. This promotes modularity, testability, and easier maintenance.

22. Can an interface extend  interfaces, and if so, how deep can the interface hierarchy go?
Yes, an interface can extend multiple interfaces in Java using the extends keyword. There's no
limit on how deep the interface hierarchy can go. Interfaces can extend multiple interfaces,
forming a hierarchy of any depth.

23. What are marker annotations, and how are they different from marker interfaces?
Marker annotations are annotations with no members, similar to marker interfaces. The key
difference is that marker annotations are more flexible and can be applied to any element
(classes, methods, fields), whereas marker interfaces can only be implemented by classes.

24. Explain the difference between functional interfaces and normal interfaces. Provide examples.
Functional interfaces have exactly one abstract method and can have any number of default or
static methods. They are used to enable lambda expressions and method references. Normal
interfaces, on the other hand, can have any number of abstract methods.

Example of a functional interface:
==================================
@FunctionalInterface
interface MyFunctionalInterface {
    void myMethod();
}
Example of a normal interface:
==============================
interface MyNormalInterface {
    void method1();
    void method2();
}

25. How do default methods in interfaces affect multiple inheritance in Java?
Default methods were introduced in Java 8 to provide backward compatibility for interfaces
when new methods are added. They allow interfaces to provide method implementations without
affecting classes that implement them. This facilitates multiple inheritance of behavior in
Java interfaces.

26. Can a class override a default method provided by an interface? If so, how?
Yes, a class can override a default method provided by an interface. If a class directly
provides an implementation for the method with the same signature as the default method in
the interface, it overrides the default implementation.

27. What is MarkerAnnotation?
In summary, while the exact use of the @MyMarkerAnnotation in the provided code snippet depends
on the specific context and requirements of the application or framework, marker annotations in
general are used to mark classes or program elements for various purposes such as metadata,
configuration, conditional behavior, or documentation.

28. Explain the implications of implementing a non-public interface (private or protected).
This is rarely used but can be done. Private interfaces restrict visibility to the implementing
class, promoting encapsulation. Protected interfaces limit access to subclasses within the same
package, potentially useful for controlled inheritance hierarchies.

29. How can interfaces be used for thread safety in concurrent applications?
Interfaces themselves don't guarantee thread safety. However, methods within interfaces can be
declared synchronized to control access when multiple threads are involved. Consider using
interface implementations that provide thread-safe behavior.

30. Explain how interfaces can be used for serialization and deserialization in Java?
Interfaces can mark classes as serializable, but the actual serialization logic needs to be
implemented in the concrete class. Consider using marker interfaces like Serializable to
indicate a class can be serialized.

// Marker interface for serialization
interface MySerializableMarker extends Serializable {
    // This interface serves as a marker and does not contain any methods
}

// Class implementing the marker interface
class MyClass implements MySerializableMarker {
    private String data;

    public MyClass(String data) {
        this.data = data;
    }

    public String getData() {
        return data;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an object of MyClass
        MyClass obj = new MyClass("Hello, serialization!");

        // Serialize the object
        try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("object.ser");
             ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(fos)) {
            oos.writeObject(obj);
            System.out.println("Object serialized successfully.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // Deserialize the object
        try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("object.ser");
             ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(fis)) {
            MyClass newObj = (MyClass) ois.readObject();
            System.out.println("Deserialized object data: " + newObj.getData());
        } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

31. How would you implement multiple inheritance in Java using interfaces? Discuss the advantages
and disadvantages of this approach compared to class inheritance.
Multiple inheritance can be simulated in Java using interfaces by implementing multiple interfaces
in a class.
Advantages include:
1. Avoiding the diamond problem.
2. Supporting composition over inheritance, promoting better code organization and reusability.
Disadvantages include:
1. Increased complexity, especially when interfaces have conflicting method signatures.
2. Difficulty in maintaining contracts and ensuring consistency across implementations.

32. Discuss the Adapter design pattern and how interfaces are used to implement it. Provide
a real-world example where the Adapter pattern can be applied?
The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a bridge between
them. Interfaces are used to define contracts for both the client and the adaptee.
A real-world example is the java.util.Collections class, which provides static methods to work
with collections. The Enumeration interface, used in older APIs, is adapted to the newer Iterator
interface using the asIterator() method in Collections.

33. Explain the concept of covariant return types in interfaces. How does it work, and what
are its benefits?
Covariant return types allow a method in a subclass to return a subtype of the return type
declared in the superclass. This allows for more flexibility in method overriding and enhances
polymorphism. It enables the use of more specific return types in subclass implementations
without breaking the superclass contract.

34. Describe how interfaces can be used for reflection in Java.  How would you handle situations
where the reflected method might not exist in the actual implementation?
Interfaces can be used with reflection to discover available methods in a class at runtime.
However, the actual implementation might not have all methods defined in the interface (e.g.,
default methods).
Utilize try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions when invoking methods through reflection,
especially for optional methods or those with specific implementations in concrete classes.

35. Discuss the design considerations and trade-offs when using interfaces for functional
programming concepts like lambdas and streams in Java 8?
1. Interfaces with a single abstract method (functional interfaces) are ideal for lambdas,
promoting concise code.
2. However, interfaces with multiple methods can still be used with streams, but require
method references or creating intermediate lambda expressions.
3. Consider the balance between readability and conciseness when designing interfaces for
functional programming paradigms.
